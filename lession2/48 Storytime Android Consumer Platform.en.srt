00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,130
As of July of 2013, one and a half

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,560
million new Android devices were being activated every day.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,080
So it's hard to believe that just a few

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,960
years ago, I started all meetings with potential developers explaining

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,079
what Android was and convincing them that it was

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,560
worth their time and effort developing for the platform.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,150
It wasn't until 2010 that we even shared numbers

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,080
to indicate the growth of the platform, 100,000 daily activations

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,729
in May of that year. Which quickly grew to

10
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:33,290
500,000 in mid-2011 and crossed the million daily activations mark

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,340
in 2012. That represents over a billion Android devices around

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,940
the world, which is why I don't start my presentations

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,320
asking if anyone in the room has an Android device

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,480
anymore. To me though, the biggest surprise in those early

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,610
days was how much effort was required to convince people

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,580
that developing for mobile at all was a worthwhile investment.

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,700
A huge number of people use their phones to go

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,810
online and many of them use their phone as the main

19
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,808
way to do so. One study by the Pew Research

20
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:04,163
Internet Project in 2013 found that nearly two-thirds of mobile owners

21
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:07,111
use their phones to go online, double the rate found

22
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:09,810
in 2009. And that a third of phone users use mostly

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,970
their phone to get online. Think about that for a second.

24
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,730
These portable phones have become pocket computers constantly connected to the

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,910
cloud to make the sum of human knowledge available

26
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,530
to us at a touch and a glance. It's no

27
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,870
wonder then that for a growing number of people,

28
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,050
mobile isn't how to get online when you're away from

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,610
your desk. It's actually displacing PCs as their primary

30
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,460
computing platform. The change is so dramatic and the trend

31
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,150
so clear that companies like Google, who depend entirely on

32
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,800
the internet, have a mobile first policy, ensuring that the

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,750
mobile experience is the first consideration when building

34
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,930
new products. This trend is particularly evident amongst younger

35
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,870
users who grew up using mobiles and especially

36
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,340
in emerging markets like Africa and Asia, where the

37
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,530
infrastructure to support ubiquitous broadband for desktops isn't

38
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,300
as readily available. I saw this firsthand when I

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,960
had the good fortune to visit Kenya a

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,380
few years ago. Ubiquitous phones and passionate, talented developers

41
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,300
weren't really familiar, but what really struck me was the degree

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,300
to which mobile phones had become an integral part of people's

43
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,940
everyday lives. It wasn't just checking email and posting to Facebook,

44
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,740
it was using [UNKNOWN] to buy everything from groceries to bus

45
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,390
fare. Mobiles was such a part of life that I heard

46
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,620
rather than buying someone a drink to show that you're interested,

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,440
you'd send them a phone credit so that they can call

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,420
you if they felt the same way. In the transition of

49
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,890
smartphones from tech accessory to a part of life to the

50
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,180
main way you get online to how you pay for things,

51
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,200
even how you flirt, represents a huge opportunity for us as

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,010
developers. The question is, how are you going to change the world?
