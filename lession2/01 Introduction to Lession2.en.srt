00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,180
In lesson one, we built a new project with a basic UI backed with mock

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,730
data. In this lesson, we'll hook sunshine up

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,140
with the Cloud, replacing the mock data with

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,397
real weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,320
To do that, we'll learn about the Android

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,860
permission system, Network I/O, and how to move

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,460
time consuming tasks off the main UI thread.
