1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,719
下一步，让我们来做一个练习
For the next step, let's do an exercise that focuses

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,400
来取出这些属性的其中一个的值
on extracting out the value of one of those attributes. We're

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,480
这次做练习的方式有点不同。你应该在
going to do this exercise a little bit differently. You'll implement this

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,740
Udacity平台上完成它。这样我们就能验证
on the Udacity platform. And we'll be able to verify that

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,420
你的代码是否正确。在这个视频结束后，你会看到一个像这样的IDE
your code is correct. After this video, you'll see an IDE

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,870
其中包含一些初始的代码
like this. Where it contains some starter code, as well as

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,790
旁边的标签页有一些Java单元测试（JUnit）代码
some j unit tests in a separate tab. In particular, we

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,780
我们希望你来实现这个函数，取得一天的最大温度
want you to implement this function, to get the max temperature

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,160
会给你一个JSON字符串，里面是天气数据
for a day. You're given a weather JSON

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,390
和之前从OpenWeatherMap服务端
string, formatted the same way as you would get

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,700
取得的JSON是一样的格式
from the Open Weather Map service. And you

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,910
另外你也会获得我们关注的那天的日期索引
also get the day index that we care about.

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,340
开动大脑来编写代码吧
Feel free to play around with the code

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,520
用Android Studio，或者其他开发环境
in Android Studio, or a separate development environment, before

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,070
之后将写好的代码粘贴到这儿。你也可以
you paste your answer here. Or you can use

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,800
直接用Udacity的IDE。如果你喜欢的话。
the Udacity IDE. Whichever feels more natural to you.
