1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,900
And now you're done with lesson two. Woohoo. You've made

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,210
a huge step in being able to transfer data from

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,090
a server and bring it all the way down to

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,100
your device. Think about all the possibilities now of valuable information

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,050
you could bring down to users to be available at

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,560
their fingertips. And that's pretty powerful. Speaking about making an impact,

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,560
have you thought about what you're going to do for your

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,540
final project yet? You can choose any topic that you want.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,570
Share your ideas in the class discussion forum, and

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,686
you can share with your friends on social media too.

11
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:34,580
Over to beta now, while I take a quick nap

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,790
on this Done pillow. I'll see you in lesson three.
