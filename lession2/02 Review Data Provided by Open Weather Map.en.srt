1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,320
On that note, we're going to make our sunshine app

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,410
100 times better now by connecting it over the network

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,360
to the OpenWeatherMap service. OpenWeatherMap provides a free weather data

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,480
and forecast API. And the site is linked below, so

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,570
you can follow along. By scrolling through the site,

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,600
you can see what type of data is available. It

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,540
also has example queries so you can click on this

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,440
one to see what the weather is like in London.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,070
It includes a user friendly description of the weather

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,280
condition, such as broken clouds, in this case. And

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,110
we'll use this later in our app. For the

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,060
full list of weather conditions, you can go back to

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,330
the main page. And scroll down. And then, click

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,790
on this link here for the Weather Condition Codes.

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,700
And on this page, we have the full list

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,000
of weather conditions. It contains everything, from scattered clouds to

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,490
freezing rain, or even volcanic ash. I don't know

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,170
about you, but hopefully that doesn't happen too often.
