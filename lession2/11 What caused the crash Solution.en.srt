If you run it on your phone, your Apple crashed

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,270
because of a network got main thread exception. We found

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,990
this answer by connecting our device to our computer and

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,790
then checking Android device monitor for the error. You can

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,220
see here that this is our package name and this

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,010
is our process ID. If you search the logs for

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,390
that process ID then our error appears. It's triggered ultimately

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,700
by a network on main thread exception. If you're curious

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,560
as to what line of our code actually caused

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,730
this, you can scroll down the stack trace to

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,940
read more. This is our framework code that you

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,570
can skip and here's where it actually hits our

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,440
app. It's within the placeholder fragment class, in the onCreateView method. And

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,680
it happens in main activity.java file, in line 116. So

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,650
if we go back to the code, on that line you can see that urlConnection.connect

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,210
actually caused the error, and that we can't do that on the main thread.
