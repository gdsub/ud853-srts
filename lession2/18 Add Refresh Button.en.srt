1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,650
As we mentioned before, you're going to still see fake

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,120
data in the app. We'll need to add code to

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,630
actually kick off a background task from the main

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,970
thread. For debugging purposes, it will be nice if we

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,630
can execute the task any time we wanted by

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,980
interacting with the UI somehow. So, we're going to add

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,650
a Refresh menu option for debugging. A warning, though,

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,100
this menu option should not shift in the final app.
