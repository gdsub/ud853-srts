1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,040
Well, the transfer isn't happening on the UI thread, but

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,750
that's not a bad thing. In fact, it's good that it's

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,900
not happening on the UI thread. So that's not a problem

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,910
either. Data transfers are an integral part of most modern smartphone

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,200
apps, so that's not a problem. The real problem is that

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,080
the transfer is happening on a thread whose lifetime is tied

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,800
explicitly to a UI component, in this case an activity. So

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,330
if the activity is terminated by something like a screen rotation,

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,080
the transfer will also be terminated.
