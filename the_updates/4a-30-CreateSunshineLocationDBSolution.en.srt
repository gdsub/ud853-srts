1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,661
Here's the solution for
the location table creation statement.

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:07,553
As I mentioned before,
we make the location setting unique.

3
00:00:07,553 --> 00:00:12,204
This is particularly important because
the ID of the existing location is

4
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:17,700
used as a foreign key in our weather
table, and therefore must not change.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,590
And this constraint will prevent
the same location setting

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,840
from having multiple IDs.
