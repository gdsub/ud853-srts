1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,160
All right.
You're done.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,100
Let's look at my solution.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,400
First, I hope you grabbed
the projection from the notes.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,370
Since we're populating a list view,
we need a weather entry ID, but

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,780
since we have a join,
we have to specify this ID precisely

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,790
with a table name followed by the dot
followed by the column name syntax.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,580
We're not using all of these columns.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,320
But, having these constant defined
will help us keep the code

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,640
compatible with the updates we
are doing in the next lessons.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,310
Of course, these indices
are tied to our projection.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,541
If the forecast columns changes,
we have to modify these accordingly.

12
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:41,640
In onCreateLoader we then pass
FORECAST_COLUMNS as the projection

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,360
into our CursorLoader constructor.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,390
Finally, we can fix
a convertCursorRowToUSFormat within our

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,870
forecast adapter to take advantage
of these declared indices.

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,790
And that's it, we're done.

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,340
Lets run it.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,550
And it looks exactly like
the last time we run it.

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,070
[LAUGH] Is pretty typical for
this section.

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,090
But the good news is that
it's still working correctly.

21
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,890
And, it's a little more efficient.

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,600
We're going to take more
advantage of this in lesson five

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,950
as we make more sophisticated
user interfaces.
