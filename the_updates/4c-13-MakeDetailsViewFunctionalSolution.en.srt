1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,750
Great.
You're done.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,930
Let me show you how I
implemented this one.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,030
Inside of detail fragment,
within detail activity.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,050
First, of course,
we add a constant for the loader.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,850
I've also added a projection for the
columns I want to get from the database.

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,660
And, of course, corresponding constants.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,680
Then we have our detail fragment
implement our loader callbacks for

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,900
cursor loader.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,530
Of course,
with parametrized type cursor.

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,020
In on create loader.

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,490
We create a new cursor loader for
the URI that came in from the intent.

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,910
In onLoadFinished, I format a string to
match what was in the original forecast

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,350
fragment and set it to the mForecast
variable as well as the TextView.

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,010
We don't have to do anything
with onLoaderReset.

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,630
Because there isn't any data that we
were holding onto that needs to be

16
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,770
cleaned up.

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,200
But, how do we fix the share intent?

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,500
I start by creating a member variable
for the share action provider.

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,730
I set this variable in
on create options menu.

20
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,820
Only if we have a forecast.

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,665
We don't make any assumptions about
the order in which our loader happens.

22
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:05,735
Finally in onload finish,
I set the share intent.

23
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:09,035
This will update the share action
provider if it already exists.

24
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,035
Let's make sure this still works.

25
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:14,290
The list as we would expect it to be and
when we click on one of these.

26
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,120
We get the detail view.

27
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,450
We even have a share action provider.

28
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,220
And as you can see, we can share it,
and there's our forecast.
