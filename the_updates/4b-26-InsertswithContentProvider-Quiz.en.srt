1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,790
The refactoring you just
completed gets our code

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,170
ready to use the weather provider.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,100
For this quiz, you're going to
code the addLocation method.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,710
As you can see, this method takes
a locationSetting, cityName,

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,070
latitude and longitude for
the new location.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,960
If the location already exists, we
return the ID of the existing location.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,690
If we add a location,
we return the ID of the added location.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,670
We can do this by first
querying the content provider,

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,020
to see if the location
query already exists, and

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,220
only performing the insert
if it doesn't yet exist.

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,120
Uncomment test add location
within test fetch weather task,

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,290
to validate your solution.
