1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,660
Now, we should be able to find the most
appropriate URL that our app should use.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,780
Based on the UX wireframes
we saw earlier, we want

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,480
the weather forecast for a week's worth
of data given a certain postal cost.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,900
For the purposes of this quiz and our
example code that we'll be showing you.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,440
We'll be using the Mountain View
postal code, which is 94043.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,000
By all means you should use the postal
code for your own location.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,890
Or you can use city name or
latitude, longitude coordinates.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,580
If it doesn't find your
location based on postal code.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,720
Try using postal code followed by
a comma, followed by the country code.

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,670
See the discussion forum for
more examples.

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,930
Next, we want the response from
the server to be in JSON format.

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,600
And we also want the temperatures
to be reported in metric units.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,410
We choose metric for
doing the query, but our UI will be

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,815
able to displace celsius or
fahrenheit based ion user preferences.

15
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:53,330
Wnd we'll just do
the conversion ourselves.

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,230
Enter the URL in the box that
fulfills these requirements.
