1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,340
Here's our solution.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,540
You are given the unique table name.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,320
The rest of this inner class
lists the columns we're going

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,350
to use to store our data.

5
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:13,110
Once again, you'll want to use the same
constant names that I used in this

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,700
solution, since the code in
the other classes you've received,

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,790
such as the weather DBHelper,
uses these same constant names.
