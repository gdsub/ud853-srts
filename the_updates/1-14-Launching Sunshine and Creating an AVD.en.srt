1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,850
And now for the moment you've been waiting for, let's hit this green Run button.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,800
It will prompt us to choose a device, without a physical device we

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,700
can test the app using the emulator that comes with the Android SDK.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,640
An Android virtual device should have already been created for

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,290
you automatically when you set up Android Studio.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,010
So you can go ahead and click OK.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,170
While the emulator's booting up,

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,130
I want to point out that if you ever want to modify your emulator devices,

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,140
you can click on this button with the purple device and the Android, and

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,520
open up the AVD manager to manage your Android virtual devices.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,210
It lists out your existing devices, and

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,600
you can always create another virtual device.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,660
You can select the category of device and then a specific device.

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,530
Then you choose which platform version it should be running on.

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,010
And this is the only one that's available on this computer now.

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,830
So Lollipop is good, and we choose the Google API's target, because it

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,810
will include some Google services already pre-installed on the emulator.

18
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,890
You can choose Next.

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,230
There's a couple more options and settings that you can modify, for example,

20
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,990
if you want an SD card, or a camera you can change those here, and

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,420
then you can go ahead and click Finish, and it'll create a new AVD for you.
