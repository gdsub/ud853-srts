00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:04,470
Using SQLite makes it easy to delete,
update, and

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,090
insert rows,
using highly expressive queries.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,230
One can even add new columns
as you revision your database,

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,500
while retaining existing user data.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,210
It's not a surprise that
just about every popular app

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,190
makes some use of SQLite in Android.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,000
It's a very powerful and important
component of the Android solution.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,610
Android also provides a huge set of
helper functions to make working with

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,870
databases easy, including functions
to automate query building,

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,430
display list views, and
even utilize pre-compiled statements.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,180
For more information about databases
in Android, see the instructor notes.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,740
Well that's what you need to know to get
started with data storage on Android.

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,570
All of this is documented
if you search for

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,950
data storage on developer.android.com.

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,495
We'll be working with these storage
APIs to build our sunshine database.
