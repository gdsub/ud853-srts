1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,969
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,220
Let's take a look at the solution.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,002
Just like in our content provider test,

4
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:13,580
we can use get content resolver to
query based upon the content URI.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,180
Remember, that the default
location entry content URI

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,160
just passes all of the parameters
into the database.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,190
So, we can easily construct a query
containing the location query

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,230
to see if it is in the database yet.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,010
Remember that the default
location entry content URI

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,320
passes all of the parameters into
the database, so we can easily construct

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,310
a query containing the location setting
to see if it is in the database yet.

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,240
If it's not,
then the query will return an empty set.

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,060
And we should insert the new city name,
location setting, and

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,870
coordinates together.

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,810
Note that we're calling that ad location
method, from inside doing background.

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,730
Which calls getWeatherDataFromJson.

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,950
We've uncommented out the test
ad location function.

18
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,520
Now, we'll run our tests,
and our tests all pass.

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,070
We're ready to move on to the next step.
