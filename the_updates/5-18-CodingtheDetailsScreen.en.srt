1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,420
So how did you break up the UI
into smaller components?

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,640
Well, you might've thought that
this could be two columns.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,970
But then it would be hard to
position the elements here.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,960
You could center them vertically
within the height of the screen.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,650
But it wouldn't necessarily line up
with the temperature views on the left

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,520
hand side.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,620
Instead this looks more like
a horizontal linear layout.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,660
Then the rest of the elements could
be laid out by using a vertical

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,720
linear layout.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,000
The vertical linear layout
would have six children.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,460
The third element would be a horizontal
linear layout composed of two children.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,990
The first would be another vertical
linear layout with these two text views

13
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,450
and the second element would be another
vertical linear layout composed of.

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,350
These two elements.

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,330
To make the contents of the whole
screen vertically scrollable

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,250
we put it inside a scroll view.

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,470
Using a list view her would be overkill
because we don't need to scale

18
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,300
to an infinite number of item and
we don't need recycling.

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,340
There's a fixed number of
fields on the screen so

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,170
the scroll view is the perfect choice.

21
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,740
I can show you our implementation for
the fragment detail XML layout.

22
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,580
We hardcoded some data in the layout.

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,250
So that it would show up as
a preview in the Design pane.

24
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,960
At the root of the view hierarchy,
we have a ScrollView.

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,260
ScrollViews can only have max one child.

26
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,470
So we set that to be
the vertical LinearLayout.

27
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,960
Inside of this layout, we have
a TextView for the day of the week.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,010
The calendar date and
then a horizontal linear layout.

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,260
This is followed by
the humidity text view,

30
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,750
wind text view, and pressure text view.

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,120
In the XMO code we see the scroll
view with the child linear layout.

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,590
We give it some padding of 16 dips so

33
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,180
that the content is not flesh up
against the edge of the screen.

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,850
Then we see the text views followed
by the horizontal linear layout.

35
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,710
We specify layout margin top of 16 dip

36
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,450
to give it some more space from
the bottom of this text view.

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,070
Within this horizontal linear layout
we have one vertical linear layout.

38
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,540
Which has a width of 0 and
a weight of 1, and

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,570
another linear layout with
a width of 0 and a weight of 1.

40
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,240
That means that both of these
children have equal width.

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,320
For this linear layout, we specify
gravity to be center horizontal.

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,110
That means that the contents inside
of it will be centered horizontally.

43
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,340
Which includes the icon as well
as the forecast text view.

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,260
Lastly we have the remaining text
views for the other weather details.

45
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,320
When the layout looks good,
we update the detail fragment.

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,460
At this point,
we also move it into its own file.

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,910
In the unload finish method,

48
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,890
we used to have a find view by
ID call to find the text view.

49
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,520
Now that the detail fragment
has a lot more views

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,940
we don't want to continue adding even
more fine view by ID calls here.

51
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,740
Because it will have to traverse
the view hierarchy every time that

52
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,790
the loader refreshes.

53
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,590
Instead we modify the on create method.

54
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,120
Once the fragment is
inflated we go ahead and

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,410
find a reference to all the views
we are going to need later on.

56
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,420
We store these views as member
variables of the class,

57
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,130
which is why the name
starts with the letter m.

58
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,520
In the on create loader method we
make sure that the projection for

59
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,950
our content provider query contains
all the information that we need.

60
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,860
It's declared at the top of the file.

61
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,430
Before we had it called
forecast columns, but

62
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,600
we just renamed it to detail columns.

63
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,860
And we also added some more columns
because now we're displaying more

64
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,590
information on the screen.

65
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,510
Then in the onLoadFinished method we get
a cursor back with the data we need.

66
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,050
We read the weather
condition ID from the cursor

67
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,790
because we're going to need it to
determine which image to display but for

68
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,300
now we can use a place order icon.

69
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,550
We continue reading from the cursor
to get the date, the description and

70
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,672
the other fields.

71
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:20,730
To format the data properly for the user
we also copied over the strings and

72
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,425
the utility method from the gist.
