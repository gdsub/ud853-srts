1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:05,210
We're still not actually inserting
weather data into the ContentProvider.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,270
So, this is a good time to
talk about BulkInserts.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,380
Remember, that BulkInsert allows
us to insert multiple rows

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,840
far more efficiently by using
a database transaction.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,130
We can apply this when we need to
insert 14 days worth of weather data

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,720
into the table.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,650
Use the ContentProvider to BulkInsert
the vector of content values into

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,250
the database.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,995
Note, there are a few lines underneath
the area where you add your BulkInsert

10
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:35,280
code that you can use to test displaying
the values you just inserted.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,300
It will read those values out of
the data base, create content values for

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,520
them, and pass them into the same
display function we already have.
