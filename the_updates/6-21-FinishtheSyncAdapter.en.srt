1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,350
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,640
Let's look at the solution.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,550
Okay, we'll begin by adding a log tag
in to our AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,580
Since this stuff runs in the background,
it's helpful to have some logging.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,590
Since we ultimately want the syncAdapter
to run in an unattended mode,

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,960
we pull the location query
from our Utility class, and

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,020
then we paste in the code from
our existing sunshine service.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,030
We'll have to patch a few things up.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,520
We'll have to call get contexts
to get the current context.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,150
For example, we copy over
the getWeatherDataFromJson function

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,690
as well as the addLocation function.

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,210
Finally we fix updateWeather
to use our syncAdapter.
