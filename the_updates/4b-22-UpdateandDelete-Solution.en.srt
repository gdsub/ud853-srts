1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,470
Alright you're done.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,170
Let's take a look at my solution.

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,310
For the delete method things
are pretty straight forward.

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,770
We just called db.delete with the
appropriate table, and the selection,

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,290
and the selection arguments.

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,980
One thing that I've done is if
the selection is null I set it to one.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,690
This makes delete all rows return
the number of rows deleted.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,290
And that can be useful.

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,190
I only notify the content
resolver of a change

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,250
if we actually have deleted some rows.

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,090
This isn't strictly necessary.

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,730
Update looks almost exactly like Delete.

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,380
Once again, based upon the URI
we select a different table and

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,560
call the update function with
the values in the selection arguments.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,860
And I only notify for a change
we've actually updated some rows.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,430
Alright.

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,510
Let's go to test our function.

18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,230
In test provider you can see we've
uncommented out test delete records

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,400
as well as test update location.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,750
Let's run the test to make sure
everything works correctly.

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,230
And as you can see everything passes.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,050
We've done everything correct for
updating and

23
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,280
deleting the content provider.
