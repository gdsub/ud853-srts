1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,740
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,150
Let's look at the solution.

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,780
Inside of our sync adapter,
right after doing our bulk insert,

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,400
we can just call the content
provider with a delete,

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,690
with the date as our current
JulianStartDay minus 1.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,090
This is one of the advantages
of using Julian days.

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,590
Done.
