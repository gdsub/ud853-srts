1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,029
Alright, you're done.

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:03,370
Let's take a look at my solution.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,160
For our first step,
we created a loader ID integer constant.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,890
These just have to be unique for every
loader you're using in your activity.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,465
Then we had forecast fragment
implement the loader manager loader

6
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:20,920
callbacks with type cursor,
as required by CursorLoader.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,448
We added our three loader
callback functions.

8
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:28,570
For on CreateLoader we move
the ContentProvider query we had for

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,330
creating the cursor, and
use this to initialize the CursorLoader.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,420
In odd load finish,

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,070
we swap the cursor in our
ForcastAdapter with our new loaded one.

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,500
In onLoader reset, we want to release
any resources that we might be using.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,680
And that's it.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,870
Let's run this, and
make sure it's all working correctly.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,740
And, as you can see,
some fabulous weather.

16
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,970
This is actually using the loader, even
though it looks exactly like the output

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,030
from the last section that we completed.
