1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,740
To build out our UI, let's start with
the wire frames for the main activity.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,000
It displays a list of forecasts
where each item contains an icon,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,630
a date, weather description, as well as
high and low temperatures for that day.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,190
Since today's weather is probably
most relevant to the user,.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,036
We give more prominence to it as the
list item compared to the other dates.

6
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:25,277
We'll start off by building the list
item layout for future dates because

7
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:29,030
it's simpler and then afterwards we'll
come back to do the today layout.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,130
In the current implementation
the list item forecast layout xml.

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,090
Is a horizontal,
linear layout of four text views.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,480
We'll need to modify the layout so
that it looks like this wire frame.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,110
We should divide and

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,590
conquer until we can use the view group
layouts that we're familiar with.

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,480
Can you imagine how you'd break down
this UI into components that you

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,129
know how to build?

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,840
As a hint,
what if I draw these separators here?

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,690
Within those elements,
can you find a way to break it down

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,540
even further with view
groups you're familiar with?

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,270
You'll need nested view groups
which means view groups

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,170
with children view groups.

20
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,050
By the way, use the view id names that
we provide in the instructor notes below

21
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,770
so that your code will match ours.

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,510
To verify that the layout
is being built correctly,

23
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,280
hard code some text
values into the fields.

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,200
Such as tomorrow for the date, or
clear for the weather condition.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,320
For images, we can specify a placeholder
drawable called ic_launcher.

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,030
It's named this way because
it's the launcher icon.

27
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,650
Which is also known as the app icon and
this is already included in our app.

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,235
We'll be getting to the rest
of the weather icons for

29
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:33,060
our app later in this lesson.

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,020
If you want to see what
this layout looks like,

31
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,910
you can click on the design
pane to see a preview of it.

32
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,060
On the right we see a component tree
listing out the different views.

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,100
We can also see for a given view what
the properties are and their values.

34
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,130
We can change the orientation of
the device that you're previewing.

35
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,900
You can also select different devices,
such as Nexus 7 or Nexus 10.

36
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,240
You can also preview multiple
devices at the same time.

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,570
As you build out your layout for this
task, don't worry about the font color

38
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,680
or font size, or
any other visual details until later.

39
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,970
After you compile and run,
the app should look something like this.

40
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,680
Every list item has the same dummy data.

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,889
When you change the layout,

42
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,280
it will actually cause a crash in your
app because your code previously assumed

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,320
that this list item layout
only had one text view.

44
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,240
So you'll need to go to
the ForecastAdapter.java file.

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,840
And comment out the lines of
code in the bindview method.

46
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,520
We're going to fix this
method in a later video.
