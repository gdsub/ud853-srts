1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,680
It will actually return a single row
containing the max high temperature.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,280
We're using a descending order for

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,720
the column, which will place the largest
value at the beginning of the query.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,880
The limit statement tells SQLite
to only return a single row.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,660
We return a row that
has the largest value.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,960
If we wanted to get
the most recent high,

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,180
we could order by max desc, date desc.
