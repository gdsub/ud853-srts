00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,100
All right, you're done! Let's go take a look at my solution. Now note,

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,050
you won't be able to actually run this code to test any of these solutions yet.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,700
But don't worry, we'll be testing soon. Here's our solution.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,510
We begin with our unique table name. The rest of the inner class,

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,310
lists the columns we're going to use to store our data.
