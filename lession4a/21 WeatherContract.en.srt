00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,260
Let's start by defining a database contract between our data and

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,580
our model. A contract is an agreement between our data model and our

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,680
views describing how information is stored. It will contain all the fields that

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,800
our user interface will display. Let's go into Android Studio to begin coding.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,340
We'll add a new package to our project named data to encapsulate the data model.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,320
Next, we'll create a contract class to store our column information.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,830
The inner classes within our contract class will be used to define tables.

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,320
Each table will implement base columns because the columns represented by base

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,820
columns are useful. The ID column, in particular, must be part of our table

00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,430
in order for our content provider integration to work later on in this lesson
