You may be thinking, lifecycles are really important.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,566
However this section, is on persisting and recovering data. Trust me,

3
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:15,210
I just want to get us coding again. However, these things are closely linked and

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,810
they're easy to get wrong if you don't understand both. As Reito mentioned,

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,300
Android saves the state of the application in bundles. You might have had

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,760
the idea that you would just save all sorts of information in these bundles and

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,259
not have to worry about any other form of persistence. But, the thing is,

8
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,540
these bundles go away as soon as the user hits the Back key in

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,040
your main activity. It's really important that they do this.

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,880
When the user chooses to close your activity with the Back key, the expectation

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,390
is that next time your activity is displayed, it will be in the default state.

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,370
If the user backgrounds your app using the Home key or the App Switcher,

13
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,680
the next time your activity is created, it should resume from the current state.
