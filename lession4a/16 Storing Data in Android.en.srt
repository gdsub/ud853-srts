00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,900
Before we dive into the session material, let's talk a bit about storing or

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,340
persisting data in Android. First of all, why do we bother to persist things

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,290
at all? This is the era of the connected cloud. Why don't we always fetch from

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,220
there? It's really nice to not start the app and see, Loading, or, even worse,

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,850
like this, a blank screen. The faster people can use an app, the more it will be

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,020
used. Obviously, if one has to select Refresh, to get it to display anything,

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,230
that would be particularly bad. Another reason to persist our data,

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,440
is that using any radio is detrimental to the battery life of the device,

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,622
especially the cellular radio. Many users aren't on meter data plans or

10
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:48,090
may be roaming when they want to use your app. All those unnecessary data

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,460
fetches can add up. There are still lots of places that don't have a network

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,910
connection available. One of the prime advantages of having a mobile app is

13
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,310
being resistant to bad or non-existent network conditions. After all,

14
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,720
you never know where the user will want to use your app. As you might expect,

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,590
Android stores your persistent data in the file system.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,360
These files can be stored in internal storage that is private to your app.

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,610
They can also be stored in shared or external storage. On older

18
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,560
Android devices this shared storage was actually on an external memory card.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,620
Today, most Android devices only emulate this card so that there is

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,520
the shared external storage apps need available on the device. Some Android

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,948
devices have emulated shared storage and secondary external storage.

22
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:45,763
Android 4.4 Kit Kat added an API to allow developers to access this secondary

23
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:51,280
external storage. We're going to focus on internal storage in this class.

24
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,140
Check the instructor notes to learn more about Android storage locations.

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,010
As I mentioned before, Android persists data into the file system.

26
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,060
It does provide two functional layers on top of the file system in the form of

27
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,350
shared preferences and SQLite. The Shared Preferences class provides a general

28
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,440
framework that allows you to save and retrieve persistent key value pairs of

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,080
primitive data types, such as booleans, floats, ints, longs and

30
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,570
strings. Shared Preferences is used by the Android preference activity to store

31
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:29,740
our settings data such as the location. Why store things in a SQLite database?

32
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,730
After all, Android supports both RAW files and Shared Preferences. For

33
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,410
the same reason that it's inefficient to find things if you throw your

34
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,590
clothes in a pile on the floor. Storing things in an SQLite database helps

35
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,730
you organize and find data easily, thanks to the power of indexing in tables.

36
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,410
An SQLite database looks something like this fragment from our weather database.

37
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,090
Note that not all fields are represented. We can perform queries using

38
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,080
SQL against this database, such as the SELECT statement here, which returns

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,650
the weather on the specified date, similar to what we'll want to do for

40
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,670
the Detail view. We can use a slightly more complex query to return a range of

41
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,730
dates, which is similar to what we do on the main forecast ListView.
