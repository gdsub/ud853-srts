00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,110
This is a good time to revisit our final detailed wire frame.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,160
For each weather forecast, we're going to need to store at least the date,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,710
the condition, the high and low temperature,

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,130
the humidity. The wind speed and direction, and the barometric pressure.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,380
Since our database will use row to represent each forecast day, we'll store

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,100
each piece of data associated with the forecast in a separate column.
