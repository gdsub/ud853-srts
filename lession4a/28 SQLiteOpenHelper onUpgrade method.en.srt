00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,120
Well now we're getting somewhere. All we have to do is run those table creation

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,274
queries by calling exact sequel at the end of our on create function. But wait,

3
00:00:10,274 --> 00:00:15,220
there's another function in our SQliteOpenHelper, onUpgrade. You might think,

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,830
why should I care about those?

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,040
I'm not upgrading anything yet. To make our development lives easier we're

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,270
going to implement the most standard kind of onUpgrade there is.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,265
You see onUpgrade only fires if you change the version of your database.

8
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:34,480
Now remember, we passed that version into the SQliteOpenHelper base constructor,

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,110
ages ago. Since we are going to be using our database as a cache for web data

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,360
and not for user generated content, we'll drop the tables. This is helpful if we

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,500
want to change the database in the future. If we were using user data, we'd do

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,610
something like use alter table to add new columns. So, now we have a database.
