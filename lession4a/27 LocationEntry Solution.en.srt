00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,510
A much simpler table. Just a standard primary key, a few values, and

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,860
a few constraints. Note that we use ON CONFLICT IGNORE. This means in insert

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,430
into the database with the same key will not actually update the database at

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,190
all. And therefore will also not return an ID in the Android helper functions.
