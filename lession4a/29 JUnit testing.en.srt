1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,600
But it will be a while before we can test this in our code. We still are going

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,870
to implement a whole layer on top of it along with a bunch of UI changes.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,740
Fortunately, we can implement J unit test here to help. And now for

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,610
some magic. We'll add a directory to the source directory of our Android studio

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,640
project called Android test. And then, another one underneath it called Java.

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,380
This is the way we tell Android studio there's a test target in cradle for

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,400
our app. Now we create a test package that matches our main package with

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,650
an extra test directory on the end. Create a new class called full

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:46,300
test suite in the test package. Add this code. This

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,970
is some boiler plate code that will allow us to add tests in additional classes.

11
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,747
Next, we'll create a TestDb class that extends Android test case [NOISE] and

12
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:04,824
add a test that creates our Db. The way this works is that the test runner

13
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:08,822
will execute every function in our class that begins with test in the order that

14
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:12,950
they are declared in the class. Each test should have a failure path that

15
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,810
uses an assert. We start by deleting the database before testing it. So,

16
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:24,180
we have a clean test. Now, to run the test we go to the app start drop down.

17
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,740
And select Edit Configurations. We select Plus to add a new configuration. And

18
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,710
select Android Tests Against Module App. Now we name the test.

19
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,190
Now note that it tends to target the emulator by default. So,

20
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to use an actual device I'm going to select Show Chooser Dialogue.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,680
Now we can just run the test against our device. And, it passes. So

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,160
let's create a data base insert and read test. At the beginning of it,

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,270
we'll insert a single record into each table. We'll begin with some dummy

24
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:04,450
data for our location. We'll use the dbHelper to get a writeable database.

25
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,180
This is exactly how we will use the database when we code it up in our project.

26
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,110
We'll then create a ContentValues object, which is a handy helper object that

27
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,280
Android uses to store values and keys. We'll store our dummy data into

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,870
the columns from our LocationEntry contract. Note that in order to make it

29
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,870
work with this abbreviated syntax, I did have to add some extra imports up here.

30
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,490
We then insert the data into our data base, and verified that we got a row back.

31
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,180
Now I find that it's helpful to put log messages into my test cases.

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,170
Now we'll use the database read operations to pull our dummy data back out of

33
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,930
the data base. We're making use of a custom projection here which, in theory,

34
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,470
would make it easy to use our database cursor to query for the values we want.

35
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,260
We use a custom projection here. Although, it's not required.

36
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,580
If the custom projection wasn't there, we would simply return all columns.

37
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,220
A database cursor is a control structure that enables traversal over

38
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,220
the records in a database. In Android, this is represented by a cursor object.

39
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,380
The cursor object allows one to traverse between records in a query and

40
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,360
get the contents of any individual column from a query.

41
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,330
Now, we use cursor.moveToFirst to populate our cursor with our row of data.

42
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,790
We can then pull out our data by index. Finally assert

43
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,049
if it doesn't match our dummy data. And now, we get to run our tests again.

44
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:39,620
[BLANK_AUDIO]

45
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,570
And they passed.
