Some good examples of answers include,

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,990
sensor listeners, location updates, dynamic broadcast receivers. Or

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,940
games physics engines. Any task that your application needs to keep happening,

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,580
even when your activity is paused. Shouldn't really happen within an activity at

00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,680
all. We'll have a look at some solutions to that problem in lesson six.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,140
