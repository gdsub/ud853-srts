All right, as the comment says below, now that we have a location let's add some

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,270
weather. Let's implement the weather part of our insert redb test. I'm going to

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,700
give you some dummy data to help you out. Note that the location key is the row

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,540
ID of the data we just inserted. Also note that I can use this short syntax for

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,668
weather entry, because I added this import at the top of the file.

6
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:26,910
Alright, so we insert that provided data that I gave you into our database, and

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,770
verify that we can read it back out again.
