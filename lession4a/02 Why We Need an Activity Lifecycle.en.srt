1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,200
Okay.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,590
So before Dan gets carried away with databases, let's look at

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,280
what happens when you use an intent to transition between activities.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,354
Within Sunshine,

5
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:13,387
if you tap on a list in the main activity it opens up the detail activity.

6
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:19,230
But the main activity remains on the backstack.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,080
Ready to reappear as soon as you hit Back.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,980
Now, in that example, both activities are within the same app.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,264
But as we learned in lesson three, you can also watch the browser or

10
00:00:29,264 --> 00:00:30,507
maps app from sunshine.

11
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:37,041
Or for that matter, the user can hit Home.

12
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:44,521
And launch apps from there, or they can use the recent key or

13
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:47,160
switch to another app using notifications.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,270
All of these options mean you can end up with a lot of apps on your back stack.

15
00:00:57,947 --> 00:01:02,440
Now, keep in mind that our resources on devices are extremely limited.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,700
So it's not a good idea to have dozens of apps sitting idle in the background.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,880
Android solves this for us,

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,320
so you don't have to use those awful task killer apps.

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,010
So, how does it do that?

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,120
Well, it kills low priority applications that you haven't used in a while.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,840
We'll go into detail on exactly how it figures out which app needs to die,

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,740
in lesson six.

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,030
But for now, it's important to realize that your app isn't in

24
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,070
control of its own destiny.

25
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,612
It can be killed at any time.

26
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:34,305
So you need to know, how to deal with that.

27
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:37,846
And that means understanding the lifecycle of an activity and the signals we

28
00:01:37,846 --> 00:01:41,180
get from the framework to indicate its progress through the lifetime.
