1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,800
Our database will contain weather forecast entries. Out data model will use

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,520
two tables. One table will be used to contain information about the location,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,480
while the other will contain the forecast data keyed the locations.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,730
These will ultimately be tied back to our view through the contract, and

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,890
the content provider. We can use an inner join, pull the complete data for

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,630
each forecast today. Including all information about the location. This,

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,230
is a big contract. Note that we store the location id, which will be a foreign

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:39,140
key from the location table in COLUMN_LOC_KEY. Note that the units aren't stored

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,440
in the database. We expect all weather entries to be stored in metric units, and

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,330
converted when needed by the UI, into imperial units. Since the column names

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,260
don't actually contain data types, it's useful to annotate that in

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,860
the variable names and/or the comments to make our contract more explicit.
