00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,060
Here's how I ended up simplifying things. I'd love to see great testing ideas.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,540
So, if you're particular to what you've created, post your solution to

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,280
the forums. I'm starting off refactoring things a little bit. What I'm

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,242
going to do is I'm going to add a function to get the location content values.

5
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:19,850
This will be useful when we actually try to use these tests for

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,650
some other things later on. And there we are. A function that'll

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,650
return location content values. I'm also going to pull the city name out so

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,690
we can use that for some validation steps later on. And there we are. It's now

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,010
inside of the function. And then we're simply going to call that function to

10
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,680
get our location content values and we can delete all those lines of code.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,610
Now, all of these columns, as I said before, are not very important, so

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,360
we can delete them. And we can also null out the value in our query.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,674
The next thing I want to do is actually fix this validation step. What we can do

14
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:57,866
is we can create a function that relies on the fact we can get the map and

15
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:02,300
set from our content values. And then we can simply iterate through those.

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,838
Then we can see if the values that we used to create the record actually past

17
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:10,410
the values in the cursor that are returned. Now, back to our task. So,

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:16,105
there's a lot of unnecessary code here now. All we have to do is call

19
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:21,710
validateCursor with our values and our cursor. All right. So now we've

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,850
converted the first test. We can do the same thing with the second test as well.

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,140
First of all, let's do the same abstraction we did before. Now, of course,

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,400
one of these values isn't going to be static, so we have to add that in.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,250
So now we can say, content values equals getWeatherContentValues.

24
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:45,240
With our all important location row ID. Remember, our tables are linked.

25
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,830
And then we can insert it into the database. Query for it.

26
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,160
If the query is successful we can just call validateCursor again on our weather

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,620
values with our weather cursor. So much less code.

28
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,870
And that's it. Our test is vastly simplified and

29
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,520
it will be useful to us later on. So now we can try running this test again to

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,318
see if it still works after the refactoring. And there we are, test passed. Now,

31
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,710
it'd probably be useful for us to actually print out some more data so

32
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,340
we can see what was being tested. But, this simplification to our

33
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,260
test is going to help us as we move forward. We're not done with testing yet.
