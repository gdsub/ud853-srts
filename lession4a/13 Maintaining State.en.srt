00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,990
As app developers, it's our job to maintain the illusion that once started,

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,680
every app is waiting patiently in the background looking for

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,670
its chance to be the star when called on. So whenever the user switches back to

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,700
your app, whether or not the system is kilted in the interim,

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,780
they should be presented with the same UI they had when they left. To help,

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,540
Android has a pair of handles specifically for persisting state in these

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,030
circumstances. On save instance data is called immediately before on pause. So

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:33,450
as soon as your app is no longer active, an on

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,630
restore instance data is called immediately after on create, but

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,220
only if the app is being restarted after having been terminated by the system.

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,880
That means you can read the bundle of state information saved the last time your

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,870
app was moved to the foreground here. The next time,

13
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,940
you'll use the switches to your app even if it was killed by the system in

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,520
the mean time. Using that bundle you can return your ui to the same state it

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,040
was the last time the user saw it creating a seamless transition that hides

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,880
the resource management happening under the covers. That's enough of the why,

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,910
let's go back to Dan and see how to put this theory into practice.
