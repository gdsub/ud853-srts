00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,240
For the purposes of the Sunshine app, this information is purely theoretical.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,700
In fact, you'll really only need to consider this later,

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,940
when you're adding things like Sensor or LocationListeners. Until then,

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,530
the default components will handle much of this behavior for

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,710
you. In any case, now that you understand the lifecycle and

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,110
the way the system handles exiting your app, when it needs its resources.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,380
You should hopefully understand why Exit or Quit buttons in Android apps serve

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,020
no practical purpose. At most, you can call finish on an activity and

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,070
it will get torn down instantly. That's actually exactly what happens when

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,290
you use a simple hits back from within their activity.

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,035
If you're still not convinced, check out the video in the instructor notes.

00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:44,030
Where I explain my reasoning with a little more, color.
