We've talked about using intents within Sunshine to start activities and send

2
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:07,390
data between apps. But what if you want to broadcast a message to

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,630
many apps? For example, the system will broadcast a message, saying that the

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,180
device is charging or that it's just finished rebooting. To do that ourselves,

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,350
we use the SendBroadcast method to broadcast an intent. And those broadcasts

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,900
are received by broadcast receivers, typically

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,430
referred to as simply, receivers. Using intent

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,010
filters, like the ones we saw earlier, they indicate which broadcast they're

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,960
interested in. So if we return to our envelope metaphor from earlier, in

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,080
the case of a broadcast intent, your

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,140
envelope is basically addressed to any broadcast receiver

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,170
that's interested in knowing that this event has

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,940
happened. And it does that using intent filter.

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,670
So intents, which are broadcast, are transmitted to every

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,980
app with a broadcast receiver that has an intent

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,349
filter telling the system your ideas are intriguing to

17
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,341
