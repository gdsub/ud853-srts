00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,460
First, we create our settings activity, and this is the code that we got

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,870
from the gist. Then, in the Android Manifest, we declare the settings activity.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,520
We give it an activity named Settings, which is declared in the Strings file.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,080
We also declare the main activity as the parent activity. That way,

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,340
when you hit the up button in the settings activity,

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,670
it will return back to the main activity.
