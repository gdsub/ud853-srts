1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,240
To move from one activity. In this case,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,210
the MainActivity in our sunshine app, to another, here

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,300
the DetailActivity, we call StartActivity. But note that when

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,490
using the StartActivity method, rather than specifying the class

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,900
name of the activity to start directly, that

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,590
class name is packaged explicitly within an intent. The

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,990
basic premise is simple. Whenever you need your app

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,950
components to communicate with each other, or the system,

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,420
you use intents to identify the

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,950
target destination. Starting activities within your

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,912
app is the simplest example. [SOUND]

12
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:38,050
With your intent explicitly indicating the target

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:44,136
using the context and a class name of the activity. Intents that use the

14
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:48,090
name of the component you're targeting directly, are known as explicit intents.
