1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,070
Now its your turn to build the temperature unit setting. This

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,590
will bring together a lot of the concepts that you've learned and

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,520
will take some time to implement, but we think you're ready for

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,650
it. Modify the app, so that the right temperature units are displayed

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,410
to the user. Use the assumption that we're syncing metric data from

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,500
the server. Eventually, we'll have a database on the device and we

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,840
don't want a mix of Fahrenheit and Celsius data in there. Hence,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,300
we'll stay consistent by getting metric data from the server. And then,

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,100
we'll convert on the fly to the preferred units when

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,330
we update the UI. After you make these changes, I'll show

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,750
you what it looks like on the device. If you

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,640
go to settings, you'll see the temperature units preference. If you

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,930
tap on that, you see a dialog with two options.

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,130
If you switch to imperial and then you go back to

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,230
the forecast list, then you see that all the temperatures now

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,660
are in Fahrenheit. Once it works, answer this question. Which subclass

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,030
of preference did you use?
