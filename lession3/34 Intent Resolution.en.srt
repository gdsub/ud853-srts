1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,330
So, how did the system know that the Maps

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,564
app could handle this Intent? The activity within the

3
00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:09,720
Maps app included an intent filter like this one

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,140
within its manifest entry. It indicates that the Maps

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,100
app is capable of performing this view action on

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,980
all data which has a geo scheme. You can

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,250
use intent filters for your activities to define the

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,470
actions they're capable of performing, and optionally, the kind

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,700
of data that they can perform it on. So,

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,194
when you use an implicit intent to address or

11
00:00:30,194 --> 00:00:32,630
request to start an activity, much like you did

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,600
with Catherine and the openweathermap.org link, Android resolves this request

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,850
by checking the intent filters of every activity that's

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,150
installed on the device until it finds the best possible

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,880
match. If multiple activities match, as in the case

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,570
with the web url, the user is given a choice.
