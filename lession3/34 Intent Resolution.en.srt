1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,330
所以  系统是如何知道地图软件能够接受它的指令的呢
So, how did the system know that the Maps

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,564
地图软件的每个活动
app could handle this Intent? The activity within the

3
00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:09,720
都会包含一个类似载货单接口的指令过滤器
Maps app included an intent filter like this one

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,140
在数据库里有一个地图方案  它指明了
within its manifest entry. It indicates that the Maps

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,100
地图软件能执行的预行为
app is capable of performing this view action on

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,980
针对你的活动  你可以
all data which has a geo scheme. You can

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,250
使用指令过滤器定义一个它们能胜任的行为
use intent filters for your activities to define the

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,470
但任意地  这类数据
actions they're capable of performing, and optionally, the kind

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,700
要能顺利执行  所以
of data that they can perform it on. So,

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,194
当你使用一个暗示指令去写地址或者
when you use an implicit intent to address or

11
00:00:30,194 --> 00:00:32,630
请求开始一个活动  更多就像你和凯瑟琳以及开放天气地图域名链接在做这件事一样
request to start an activity, much like you did

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,600
安卓解决这类请求的方法
with Catherine and the openweathermap.org link, Android resolves this request

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,850
是通过检查每个活动的指令过滤器
by checking the intent filters of every activity that's

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,150
直到这些被安置在设备上的活动找到可能的最佳
installed on the device until it finds the best possible

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,880
匹配  如果有多种匹配方式  就根据网址域名的实际情形
match. If multiple activities match, as in the case

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,570
使用者有选择的机会
with the web url, the user is given a choice.
