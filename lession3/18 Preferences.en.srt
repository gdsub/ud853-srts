Open up the Developer API Guide for Settings, if you want to follow along.

00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,000
If you've pondered it carefully and you've decided you really want this to

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,290
be a setting, this is what you do next. Android provides a way to display

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,450
a hierarchy of preferences, including headers, such as the ones shown here.

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,210
The value of the preference is called the preference summary, and that's seen

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,740
here. It looks almost like the subtitle text. The preference also provides UI.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,330
To allow users to modify that setting. You just need to supply the strings, but

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,470
you don't have to implement the UI like the spinner here.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,770
Common preference types are the check box preference, list preference,

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,460
edit text preference. We can see some examples in the settings app under

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,670
developer options. Here's a bunch of preferences. This is an example of

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,380
a check box preference. This is an example of a list preference where you

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,570
have different radio button options here. Once the user changes the setting,

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,890
it gets saved in the default share preferences file. This stores a bunch of key

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,390
value pairs of primitive data. An example integer preference could be how many

16
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,550
days of e-mail history should be saved locally on the device. You could have

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,000
a string stored integer preferences for what the currently selected account and

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,620
device is. Then at any time you can fetch the value of this shared preferences,

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,540
as long as you pass in the name of the key that you want.

20
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,060
You can also use shared preferences outside the context of settings as well.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,080
This information is located in the developer API guide, for

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,530
storage options, which is also linked below.
