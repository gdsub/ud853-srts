Hey Dan, we finished the settings. Do you want to check it out?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,120
>> Oh, great.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,180
>> Wait. What's with all this stuff right here?

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,790
>> I'm glad you asked. All this stuff will help me demonstrate the

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,150
power of implicit intents. Leveraging other

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,080
apps to get functionality for your app

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,330
for fee. For example, why would you write a bar code scanning app,

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,282
when you can just launch an intent to do it for you. [SOUND].

9
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:25,748
>> Or a camera app, where you can just launch

10
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:29,839
an intent to fire a photo. [SOUND] And of course, it would make no sense to

11
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,181
write a phone app just to dial a phone number, you would just call the intent.

12
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:36,124
>> Wait, I need that.

13
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:40,280
>> In other words, don't reinvent the wheel. Lazy programmers make fewer

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,620
mistakes. Now, let's go implement an

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,450
implicit intent. Raydo? Dan's being implicit again.
