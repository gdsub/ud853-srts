00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,070
We start by right-clicking on our package name to create the new activity from

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,620
the Blank Activity with Fragment template. So

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,950
for name, we use DetailActivity, and again, the

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:17,930
hierarchical parent of this class is going to be our main activity. So as you

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,840
can see, we now have a new

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,380
DetailActivity along with the XML for activity_detail and

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,070
a fragment associated with that activity. Great! You're

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,240
done. But we still aren't launching our new activity.
