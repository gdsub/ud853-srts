1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,430
Now it's time to launch the SettingsAactivity from the menu item.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,950
We need to launch it from two places, the MainActivity and the DetailActivity.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,000
Afterwards, compile and run the app to make sure that it works. This is what it

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,883
should look like. From the MainActivity, if you tap on Settings menu,

5
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:22,030
it should bring you to the SettingsActivity. It is expected for it to be blank,

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,320
because we haven't populated it yet. Now let's try the DetailActivity.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,940
If you tap on the Forecast, you can go into the DetailActivity and

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,710
then, you can go into the SettingsActivity. Complete the task and

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,710
then verify that your app behavior is like this.
