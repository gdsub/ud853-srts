00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,420
Let's go through the wire frames for the settings UI.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,010
Within the detail activity in the overflow menu, there's a settings menu item.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,970
When you tap on the setting's menu item, it opens up the settings activity.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,800
If you tap of location, it pops up a dialog, where you can enter in your

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,320
postal code. Feel free to use your preferred method for inputting location,

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,970
such as city name. Just verify that the data coming back from the server is for

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,420
the location you expect. Note that there's no validation on this string input.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,528
If you're trying to make this app a production app, you would want some kind of

9
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:39,070
air handling here. If you tap on pick your units, it opens up a dialogue

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,820
where you can choose to display temperature within the app as wither metric or

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,640
imperial units. This is basically just Celsius or Fahrenheit, and

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,280
that is what this settings activity does. Remember that you don't want to make

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,570
everything a setting. If you're discussing a feature with a teammate and you

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,010
can't decide on something, don't compromise by just making it a user setting.

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,180
There are instances where making a difficult product decision now will be better

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,050
for the user, because then they won't have the burden of having to decide what

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,020
the value of the setting should be. And remember, there's always an opportunity

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,490
in an app update to add the setting later. If you add it to begin with, it's

19
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,090
infinitely harder to take away the setting because some users might get angry

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,210
with you. If you're having trouble deciding if something should be a setting or

21
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,765
not, you can check out the setting section in the Android design guide,

22
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:30,170
which is linked below. It contains a workflow diagram that could help you.

23
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,820
Very few roads often lead to making something a setting.
