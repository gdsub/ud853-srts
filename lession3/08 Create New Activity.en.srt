00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,180
You're going to use Android Studio to create the

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,140
detail activity from the blank activity with fragment template.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,980
The template asks for the hierarchical parent of detail

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,680
activity, which defines the up button noted by the

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,320
app icon, and a left pointing carrot here. But

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,910
what does up mean? If you mapped out a

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,630
hierarchy of all screens in the sunshine app, the

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,150
root of the tree would be the main activity, and

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,260
it's child would be the detail activity. So, the

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,960
app goes to the main activity. While the back button

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,530
can achieve the same effect, it can also bring

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,920
you back home or to another app, depending on your

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,440
history of screens. Up will always navigate you within

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,290
the same app to the parent, regardless of how you

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,050
arrived at this screen. Create the detail activity now,

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,220
and look at how the activity is declared in the

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,470
Android manifest file.
