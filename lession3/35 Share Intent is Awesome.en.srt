1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,070
One of the most used implicit intents

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,490
in Android is the share intent. It's [LAUGH]

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,560
awesome. It's a great way to waste time

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,356
for both you and your friends. [SOUND] [LAUGH].

5
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:12,720
>> Dan!

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,780
>> You can leverage your favorite apps to share photos, texts,

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,910
videos and general links. And the best part is you don't have

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,990
to even know what the user's favorite apps are. Just tell

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,840
Android what data you want to share and it shows your users

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,050
a list of apps that will share it. Apps that

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,680
may not have existed when you app was written. To

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,660
make it even easier to share Android 4.0 added the

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,070
share action provider and we have it for previous releases of

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,270
Android as part of a support library. It operates using

15
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,890
the action send intent. If we use Raytoe's glorious envelope metaphor,

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,510
it would be addressed to anyone who could perform action

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,490
send. The data descend would be included with it as extras

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,060
either as text, or URI to the binary data. And

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,600
the MIME type would indicate what the URI points to.

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,470
Here's what the share action provider will bring to

21
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,850
our app: the glorious wire frame. There will be

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,270
an additional icon in the action bar which will

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,980
drop down a menu when clicked to reveal potential

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,150
share actions. Another icon will be added to the

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,640
right of this one that contains the last application

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,450
shared to. Add a ShareActionProvider to the fragment within

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,000
DetailActivity. It will share weather in the following format.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,844
Yes, it's just the string we passed into the view plus #SunshineApp.
