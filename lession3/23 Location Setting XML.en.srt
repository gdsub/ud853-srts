1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,310
We have our settings screen but no settings.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,550
In the next several sections you're going to be adding our two settings.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,510
I'll walk you through how we add our first setting for

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,780
location, then you'll do the temperature setting on your own, so listen closely.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,818
First we design a preference XML file.

6
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:18,320
The root element should be a preference screen.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,750
In this example we have a check box preference and

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,130
a list preference inside of it.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,260
In order to add the preferences XML file to our app,

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,570
we first need to create an XML folder under the resources res directory.

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,680
Right-click on the res folder, go to new Android resource directory and

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,210
then type in XML as the name of the directory.

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,905
For resource type you can use XML and then hit OK.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,490
Inside this folder, we right-click to create a new XML resource file.

15
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,650
We call it pref_general,

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,990
and the root element is a preference screen as we saw on the developer's site.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,020
And then our preferences file is created.

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,980
Then add the location preference.

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,420
Since the wireframes showed an editable text field to input user location as

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,318
a string, we make this an EditTextPreference.

21
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:10,620
If you want to learn more about all the possible XML attributes,

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,370
you can google for EditTextPreference.

23
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,890
First we specify a title for

24
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,230
the preference which will be the label that's displayed to the user.

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,170
Then we specify a key.

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,690
And this key is actually the key value in SharedPreferences.

27
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,610
Going back to the code, we also add these attributes to describe the Edit Text

28
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,780
field in the pop up dialog that was shown in the wire frames.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,440
Going back to the code, we can also configure properties of the Edit Text field.

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,890
We specify the input type to be text, and we cap it to a single line of text.

31
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,790
It's bad practice to hard code these strings here,

32
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,290
so we declare them as constants in the strings.XML file.

33
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,970
These are the strings we declared.

34
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,520
This is the name of the label of the preference.

35
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,390
It's user-visible, so we add a char limit for translation purposes.

36
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,840
You also specify location which is the name of the key in Shared Preferences.

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,730
We don't want to translate it because we always want to find the key based

38
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,060
on this name.

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,169
We also specify a constant for the default location.

40
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,690
We also don't translate this because we need to send it to the server API

41
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,750
like this.

42
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,540
When you're done with these steps check them off and continue
