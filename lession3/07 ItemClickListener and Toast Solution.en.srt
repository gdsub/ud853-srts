00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,810
Done already? Let me show you how it's done. As I said before, we

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,640
get the forecast by calling getItem from

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,940
the forecast adapter. And here's how we actually

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,542
display the toast. Note that the context

5
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:17,023
is actually available through getActivity in our

6
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:20,982
fragment. However, it won't do anything unless

7
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:25,450
we also show the toast. Displaying a toast

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,170
is useful to see how an Android interaction works. But this method should

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,060
really be used to start our detail activity. This is what we'll do next.
