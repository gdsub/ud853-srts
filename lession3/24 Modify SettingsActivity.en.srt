1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,650
To make the preferences appear on the phone, we

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,730
need to modify settings activity. In the on-create method

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,270
we're going to replace this to do with some code.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,111
We're going to call addPreferencesFromResource with the pref_general xml

5
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:16,700
that we defined. Then we need to bind the

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,780
preference summary to the value of the location preference.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,320
This means that when the user changes the preference,

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,820
the summary value underneath the label will be updated.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,090
If you look at the declaration of this method,

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,640
we see that for a given preference, it sets a

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,590
preference change listener on it. If you scroll to

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,870
the top, you see that the settings activity actually implements

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,580
the interface on preference change listener. That method is

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,990
found down below, where we override the on preference change

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,380
method. Remember that our location preference is actually an

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,010
edit text preference. So, it won't fall into this case,

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,940
but it will fall in this case down here. Then,

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,970
in the settings UI you can see that the summary

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,240
is now this value. Make these changes in your app.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,680
See the instructor notes for the lines of code you need.
