00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,969
Once the user's location preference has been stored. When do

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,340
we make use of it? We need the preferred location on

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,380
we query the weather service. Luckily, in lesson 2, we

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,390
modified fetch weather task to accept a location parameter. We hard

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,550
coded it to be the Mountain View zip code. But

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,960
now we should use the location stored in shared preferences. We

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,570
haven't explicitly shown you how to do this. So you might

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,210
need to do some digging around. On the Ander developer site

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,550
to figure out how to do it. Once

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,790
you've made the change, check the box to continue.
