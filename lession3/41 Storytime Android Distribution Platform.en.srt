1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
50. That's how many apps were available in

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,680
Android Market as Google Play was named when

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,750
it first launched alongside the first Android device

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,800
in 2008. A few days later, Android Market

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,200
opened for all app developers to register and

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,150
start publishing their apps without any review or

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,910
validation requirements from Google, OEMs, or carriers. For

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,065
us as developers, the ability to distribute apps and

9
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:28,300
the possibility of monetizing them through up front payments

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,320
in app billing and advertising directly to the owners of

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,920
over a billion android devices is one of the

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,860
most exciting opportunities made possible by the android ecosystem. Growing

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,830
up the dark days before smartphones and the internet,

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,770
if I wanted a new game or app I had

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,860
to go to a physical store and pay for a

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,650
cardboard box filled with floppy disks or CDROMs. As developers

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,680
a big part of our business plan back then

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,830
was how to get those boxes of our software onto

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,900
those shelves. Or in the world of mobile, how

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,350
to secure a carrier or OEM deal to get our

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,500
apps preloaded onto the devices. Today I can install

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,992
over a million apps of games created by tens if

23
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:12,400
not hundreds and thousands of developers via Google Play, all

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,010
with a click of a button. That's translated into tens

25
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,070
of billions of app installs. An incredible opportunity to

26
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,000
distribute apps to Android users in hundreds of countries.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,650
Now, in the early days of Android, being fast

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,840
and launching first was a pretty solid strategy for success,

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,910
but as those first 50 apps quickly grew to

30
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,300
hundreds, thousands, and now over a million apps, it takes

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,710
a lot more than speed to stand out in

32
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,320
the crowd. These days the tables stakes are a base

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,830
line of quality and willingness to create great experiences

34
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,500
for all your users. Of course app quality can

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,360
be somewhat subjective, but over the years we've identified

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,200
the core criteria that users identify with apps of

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,130
high quality. And to make your life easier, they're

38
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,940
all available on the Android developer site for you

39
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,440
to review. This is the same checklist that the

40
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,590
merchandising team for Google Play used to ensure only apps

41
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,130
of quality are featured in their promotions and

42
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,800
editor's choice categories. And they include everything, from following

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,130
the app design guidelines to supporting different screen orientations,

44
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,410
tablets, and other devices. And of course ensuring that

45
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,860
your app is stable and performant. So, with over

46
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,780
a million apps already available in Google Play it's

47
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,680
no longer just a numbers game. We don't need

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,570
just more apps or games, or even more developers.

49
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,770
What we want is high quality apps from great developers, like you.
