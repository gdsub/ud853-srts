00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,440
In this lesson we added new activities to our

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,950
apps and explored ways to structure and navigate between them.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,370
And that meant learning all about intents and how

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,150
they're used in Android. Next up in Lesson 4, we're

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,740
going to learn about the activity life cycle and make

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,150
our apps that much more useful by saving data. We'll

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,620
begin to databases and learn about content providers, but

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,230
first let's take another journey into the history of Android.
