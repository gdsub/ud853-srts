1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,070
在所有搭载Android系统的设备中
Of all the Android launch devices,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,920
Nexus 1在我心中一直都占有着一个特殊的位置
the Nexus 1 will always hold a special place in my heart.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,860
这并不是说我的第一款Android设备  HTC G1就不重要了
That's not to take anything away from my first Android device,

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,810
HTC G1以其独特的下巴部分和侧滑全键盘
the HTC G1, that launched Android to the world with its distinctive chin

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,930
把Android系统推向世界
and slide-out keyboard.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,320
还有HTC Magic  我加入Google后
Or the HTC Magic, first prerelease android phone

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,520
内部试用的第一款预发布Android手机
I got to dog food when I joined Google.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,430
HTC Magic也是第一款被赠送给
And the first, the wave of devices we gave every attendee

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,320
09年Google I/O大会每位与会者的手机
starting at Google I/O in 2009.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,180
2010年Android从仅仅是有趣变成了全球化的现象
2010 was the year Android went from "that's interesting" to global phenomenon.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,510
5月份Android系统每天的激活量有10万
Growing from 100,000 activations a day in May,

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,070
到了12月份这个数字就增长到超过30万了
to over 300,000 by December.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,310
这个增长大大得益于摩托罗拉Droid的发布
That was seriously helped by the release of the Motorola Droid.

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,850
我到现在都记得  随着每台Droid的重启
I can still remember the offices here in Building 44,

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,780
这里的44号楼办公室中不停地回响着Droid的经典铃音
echoing with the constant refrain of "Droid" as each device rebooted.

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,660
Droid是第一款外观更纤薄  分辨率更高  续航更持久的Android设备
The Droid was the first of the thinner, higher res, more powerful Android devices

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,960
自问世就成为了Android设备的标准
that have since become standard.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,510
也正是Droid在美国通过Verizon的上市
And it was also the device whose release on Verizon here in the U.S.,

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,400
真正地开创了Android系统激活的大潮
really kicked off the flood of Android activations.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,096
但那时我还在伦敦  Droid又仅支持CDMA制式
But I was a Londoner then, and the Droid was a [inaudible] only phone,

21
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,842
所以我并没有真正地使用Droid
so it was never really a device I truly used.

22
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:10,620
后来  就出了Nexus 1  代号为Passion
Then, there was the Nexus 1, code-named Passion.

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,160
这是第一款让我领略到纯净Android系统的手机  也是我们带着参加2010年的
The first device I felt was pure Android, was also the phone we brought with us

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,990
Android开发者实验室世界巡回之旅的手机
on our 2010 Android Developer Labs World Tour.

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,280
我和我的同事们横穿全球
Me and my colleagues traveled across the world.

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
10天之内走了7个城市  通过演示活动和免费赠送一部Nexus 1
Seven cities in ten days, introducing over 20,000 developers

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,450
我们向2万多开发者介绍了Android系统
to Android by way of presentations and a free Nexus 1.

28
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,560
结果是我在欧洲交了不少朋友
As a result, I made a lot of friends across Europe,

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,890
并知道了在穿越斯德哥尔摩的雪堆和
and learned exactly how many boxes of phones

30
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,530
柏林结冰的马路时  自己到底能背多少箱手机
I can carry across snow drifts in Stockholm, and icy roads in Berlin.

31
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,540
自那以后  Nexus S 4和5这三款手机都持续改进
Since then, The Nexus S4 and 5 have each improved on what it takes

32
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,610
并成为了出色的Android手机
to make a great Android phone.

33
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,820
全球的原始设备制造商还生产了数以千计的各种各样的Android设备
And OEMs across the world, have created thousands of different Android devices.

34
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,483
从Motorola Xoom开始
Starting with the Motorola Xoom,

35
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:54,306
Android正式进军平板市场
which led Android's official expansion into tablets,

36
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:57,030
也为Nexus 7和10带了路
and leading the way for the Nexus 7 and 10.

37
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,830
但那仅仅是一个开始
But that was just the start.

38
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,590
这些改变为Android大规模占领市场铺平了道路
Those changes paved the way for the Android [inaudible]

39
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,990
使Android系统成为所有设备的后台大脑
to grow into what could be, the brains behind anything

40
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,870
从电话和平板  到电视  汽车和可穿戴设备  比如Android Wear
from phones and tablets, to TVs, cars and wearables, like Android Wear.

41
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,940
谁也无法知道Android下一个作品是什么
It's impossible to know, what comes next.

42
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,950
谁知道呢
Who knows?

43
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:15,771
也许下个Android设备就是Android机器人本身
Maybe the next Android devices, will be Androids themselves.
