00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,910
All right. We're just going to add a few more details to the app.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,860
We're going to implement a weather notification

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,760
preference. We'll do this by adding a

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,240
new preference to the app settings to turn off notifications. And then, use

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,640
that preference to turn off the notification.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,650
Hint, you're going to want to use a CheckBoxPreference
