1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,350
All right, you're done. Let's look at the solution. If you

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,570
guessed that we were going add this code to Sunshine sync adapter,

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,570
you would've been right. We're actually going to place the code right

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,720
here, because this is where we know we've done a successful insert.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,840
So what do we do? So we start off with the

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,370
calendar object, for the current day. Then we add negative 1 to

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,770
the date which means it points to yesterday. Finally, we convert

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,480
that into a database-friendly string. And then we do a query to

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,270
delete everything less than or equal to that day.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,830
Done. It's always good to clean up after yourself.
