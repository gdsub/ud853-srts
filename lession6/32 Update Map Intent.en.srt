All of you detail-oriented people probably noticed that

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,640
we never actually used the coordinates we get

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,440
from the server for location, relying instead on

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,760
both the maps API, and the weather API to

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,440
do the same thing with location queries. Unfortunately,

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,680
they don't always agree. Implement maps using the coordinates

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,700
stored in the location table. You'll want to start

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,260
by moving the menu code from MainActivity to WeatherFragment.
