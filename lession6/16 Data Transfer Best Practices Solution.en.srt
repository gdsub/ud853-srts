00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,250
Pulling down all the data will reduce latency and maximize the

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,520
battery efficiency. But it's unlikely the user is going to read every

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,030
article. So you'd just be wasting a lot of bandwidth. Downloading

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,270
all the articles without pictures actually doesn't improve our efficiency if

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,560
you're just downloading the front page, because you'll still need to

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,470
activate the radio to download those pictures whenever an article is

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,460
selected. The right answer is to get the headlines and the

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,360
articles linked to from that front page, 'cause they're the most likely

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,010
to be read as the user starts

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,280
browsing through the app. You can then incrementally

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,640
download more articles each time the user moves

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,460
into an area you haven't pre-fetched for yet.
