1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,730
The cell radio in your device operates roughly like this.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,320
From an initial idle state, it takes a couple of seconds

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,120
to turn on until it can start transmitting. That kind of

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,430
latency makes for a sucky web browsing experience. So rather than

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,850
going back to idle, state machine stays on at full power

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,730
for a certain amount of time. Typically, around five to ten

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,940
seconds before dropping to an intermediate low power mode that uses

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,860
less battery than full power, and has lower latency to return

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,661
to full power than the standby mode. If a new

10
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,370
transfer is initiated, the radio will be promoted back to

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,560
full power mode. And if nothing happens for another period

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,020
of time, typically around 30 seconds to a minute, it'll

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,690
drop back to standby. The exact latency in tail times

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,000
varies between carriers, and even in carriers between states and

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,910
countries, as they try to balance low latency with longer

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,380
battery life based on factors like cell congestion and typical

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,830
prevailing network conditions. So the exact timings vary. How

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,630
do we optimize our transfer frequency? Ultimately, it doesn't matter

19
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,120
what the specific timings are. You just need to

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,712
understand that the network is going to attempt to balance

21
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:07,740
low latency with high battery life. For us, when

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,650
it comes to planning out data transfers, we really like

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,960
to be somewhere around here,. Now, if we return

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,550
briefly to the cell radio state machine, we know that

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,370
every time we perform a data transfer, the radio will

26
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,550
stay active for at least another five seconds of full tail

27
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,260
time, and anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute at low

28
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,010
power before it finally returns to standby. That means every time

29
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,830
you initiate a transfer, you're powering the cell radio up for

30
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,060
at least 20 seconds. So let's take a look at how

31
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,660
that affects an app, using the little cookie approach. An app

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,550
like this can drain the battery without even having to transfer

33
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,720
much data. Each of these small peaks is

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,270
an app pinging its analytics back to the server,.

35
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,940
In this case, every 15 seconds. These logi-peaks represent

36
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,540
intermittent data transfers based on user interaction. For example,

37
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,590
they may be viewing a restaurant listing or looking

38
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,900
at tomorrow's weather forecast. Beneath it, we've graphed how

39
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,230
this affects the radio state. The blue shows active

40
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,800
data transfers. The red, the radio in full power.

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,090
And yellow showing low power mode. The gaps in between, if

42
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,340
there were any, indicate when the radio was idle. So while

43
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,370
this app is running, what is the percentage of time that

44
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,180
the cell radio is able to go back to its idle state?
