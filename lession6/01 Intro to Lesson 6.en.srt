00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,540
Now that we've finished build the UI for our app,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,660
it's time to think about how it should operate when it's

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,280
not in the foreground. One of the most powerful features of

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,930
Android, is the ability for any app to run in the

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,070
background. But with great power comes great responsibility. So, you need

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,920
to be very conscious of how it's consuming resources. In this

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,820
lesson, you'll learn more about how the Android framework manages background

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,470
apps and you'll be introduced to the service class to help

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,480
make that happen. You'll also learn techniques for efficient

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,920
data transfers using sync adapters and Google Cloud messaging. And

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,520
be introduced to the notification framework to send messages

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,820
to your users when your app isn't in the foreground.
