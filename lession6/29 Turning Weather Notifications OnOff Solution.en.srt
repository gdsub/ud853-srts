1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,010
Alright, you're done. Let's start by adding all of

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,130
the strings we're going to need for our new preference.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,278
Key, label, and something like true, false, and default.

4
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:14,010
Then we'll additional preference into pref general xnl, a check

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,560
box preference that uses those strings we just defined.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,730
Let's go over to our sync adaptor. In the notify

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,820
function, we add the code to fetch the preference

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,480
and make use of it. And there we have it.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,560
Now we won't display notifications if the user doesn't want us

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,810
to, which is a great thing for an app to do.
