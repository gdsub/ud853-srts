1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,455
So now that we understand how services work,

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:06,630
let's review how Android determines your app's priority. App

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,320
priority is divided into three general buckets. Critical,

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,370
high, and low. Within each bucket the apps are

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,690
prioritized in a queue. With the app that's

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,300
been at the lowest priority for the longest, the

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,450
first to be executed. Critical apps are those that

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,780
are active. They're in the foreground, interacting with users.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,200
That includes activities in the foreground and apps

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,570
running foreground services. High priority apps, include any visible

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,620
activities and any application with a running service.

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,760
While less impactful than killing a foreground app, destroying

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,720
visible activities or cancelling services running tasks like

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,410
background updates it's still going to be noticeable to users.

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,960
So, the system will only kill them in

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,520
an extreme resource crunch. Apps in the background though,

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,750
they're the red shirted ensigns of the app priority

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,550
landing party. Any background app will be killed as

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,370
needed, in a last seen, first killed order, in

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,610
order to help support the higher priority apps. I like

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,769
to think of this as the three laws of

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,250
Android resource management. Law one, Android will keep all apps

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,480
that interact with the user running smoothly. Android will

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,190
keep all apps with visible activities or running services running.

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,260
Unless doing so violates the first law. And third, Android will keep all

26
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,340
apps in the background running, unless this

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,990
violates the first or second laws. So

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,930
with all of that in mind, consider these four apps. What do you

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,260
think is the priority order of each of these apps, according to the system.
