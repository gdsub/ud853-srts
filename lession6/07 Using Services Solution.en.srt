00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,900
All right, you're done. Let's talk about how I

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,280
solved this one. First, let's take all our code, and

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,560
copy it from the fetch weather task. The intent

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,010
service actually creates a helper thread for us to run

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,300
on. Similar to what async task does. So we

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,080
can just copy this stuff from doing background to on

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,240
handle intent. Let's add a few helpful constants, such as

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,550
log tag and an Intent Extra, so we can pass

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,430
in the location query. Now, we're just going to

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,590
go through and clean up some of the errors.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,110
After all, Intent Service doesn't return a value. And

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,790
since it's a service, it has its own context.

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,933
And that's it. We've turned out fetch weather task

14
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:44,750
into an intents service, pretty straightforward. Now we just

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,200
need to call it. So, now in the update

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,830
weather function from within forecast fragment, we can call

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,430
the service using an explicit intent,

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,620
putting the parameter into an intent extra.

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,640
All right, let's take a look at how that runs. And when we

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,440
hit the refresh button, it'll use our new service. Pretty nice. And we

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,330
really can't tell any difference, which is how we'd expect things to be.
