1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,600
Now, at first glass, reducing the payload of each transfer, and

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,330
only transmitting data when it's required seems like a sound approach.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,830
You're reducing the amount of data being transferred, so that's less

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,300
data on the network. That's less superfluous work being done storing processing

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,730
data on the device. It's basically a case of putting off

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,040
any work, until you actually know you need to do it.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,630
But it turns out that this approach has it's drawbacks, compared

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,220
to the big cookie model of all of that work up front.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,110
So, overall, this is a better solution. But let's take a closer look at the big

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,670
cookie model. And to do that, we really

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,360
need to understand the underlying cell radio state machine.
