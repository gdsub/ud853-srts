1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,330
All right, here's a big one. Finish

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,290
the SynchAdapter, making it fetch the weather

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,470
and store it in the database. Alter

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,740
the updateWeather function within the ForecastFragment to

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,710
start a sync with the SyncAdapter. Some things here. Pull the code from on

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,070
handle intent into our SyncAdapter. On handle

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,150
intent is inside of our Sunshine service.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,040
The good news is that abstract threaded

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,510
sync adapter provides a background thread to

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,460
run the server fetch on, just like

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,370
intent service does. Also, just fetch the location

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,110
query from our utility class. Eventually, we

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,030
want to run syncs like this without any

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,690
involvement of the user. Finally, make the

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,810
sync adaptor run when we call Update Weather.
