00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,070
So, how would we use a service to

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,190
implement our application? Fortunately, we've already done most

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,880
of the work. We have a content provider

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,160
with a content notifier that will notify our

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,370
content observers. Our FetchWeatherTask already runs completely independently

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,460
of our UI. Good on us. Now, we

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,790
can make use of that Intent Service that

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,780
Rato mentioned earlier. With just a few small

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,230
changes, we can get our code working,

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,630
with an Intent Service, instead of with our

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,280
Fetch Weather task. To start, let's create a

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,660
new package for our service. [SOUND] Then we'll

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:44,476
add a new Java class in that package that extends inside Service. We hit Ctrl+I

14
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:47,270
to once again, add the required abstract method.

15
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,780
And Ctrl+O in order to add the constructor.

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,420
Since the service is an Android component, you guessed it, it needs to be in the

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,200
manifest. Okay, let's do this. Let's finish implementing the SunshineService

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,490
and call it from ForecastFragment. You can start a service using an intent with

19
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,830
the StartService method. It will help to remember how to use explicit intents.
