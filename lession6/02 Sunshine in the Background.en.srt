00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,840
Remember back in lesson two when Katherine used a

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,030
AsyncTask hooked up to a refresh button to update

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,310
our data? Rato talked about how that was a

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,290
bad idea, because the AsyncTask is not tied to

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,610
the activity life cycle. The virtual machine will hold

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,960
on to the activity object as long as the

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,190
AsyncTask is running, even after Android has called onDestroy

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,130
for the activity and expect it to be discarded.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,380
If you rotate your phone, the behavior is to

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,810
destroy your activity and instantiate a new one. The

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,400
naive AsyncTask implementation now has two threads trying to

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,290
perform the same update, and so forth. The point is,

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,910
it's not the best pattern for a potentially very

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,680
long background operation, such as fetching from web services. If

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,410
you leave the app, the asynctask will continue to

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,340
run for as long as your process is kept alive,

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,750
but will run at a low priority, and your process

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,900
will be the first thing to be killed if the device

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,760
needs more resources. And there's a bigger problem. Your app

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,660
has to be visible and running in the foreground to instantiate

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,590
the task in the first place. Because we started a

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,000
task, to update the weather when we started the app, this

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,070
can have undesirable behavior if the weather changes rapidly. So

24
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,110
now we're going to learn the right way to perform updates.

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,700
We'll want to automate the process while the app is in

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,690
the foreground. But even more importantly, we want the app to get

27
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,690
regular updates in the background with minimal battery drain. That will

28
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,660
be especially important later in this

29
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,010
lesson when we introduce weather notifications.
