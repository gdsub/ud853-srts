1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,350
Let's take a look at what it will

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,630
take to implement a very basic SyncAdapter. We're going

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,430
to write two services. Each service serves the primary

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,530
purpose of delivering an object that represents an Android

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,780
Binder interface to one of the system frameworks.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,400
A Binder is actually the low-level glue that implements

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,400
cross process communication in Android. You've been using Binders

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,750
every time you talk to an Android system service.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,520
Intents and content providers are just high-level abstractions on

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,600
top of the Binder interface. There's a whole language known

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,290
as AIDL to help define these interfaces. We're not

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,710
going to cover all this here, but there's a lot

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,620
more you can do with services and Binders. One

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,370
more thing before we start, we're going to define an

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,960
Authenticator Service and an Authenticator. But it will only

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,780
be used by the Android accounts framework to allow us

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,320
to create an account. SyncAdaptor's need an account.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,300
And the account framework requires that there be

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,780
an authenticator delivered by an authenticator Service. You'll

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,890
see that our authenticator is just a series

21
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,250
of stubs, with exceptions that get thrown for

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,290
each call just to prove that it isn't

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,210
really used. One final note. This section approximately

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,060
follows the online training at developer.android.com around sync adapters.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,860
Feel free to look there if you have

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,680
any more questions. We're going to create a new

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,550
package, sync, to house all of this goodness.

28
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,210
And a new class file for our authenticator. This

29
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,200
code that we're about to paste in really

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,920
just comes from the developer.android.com website, and as I

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,660
mentioned earlier it's just a stub. You can tell

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,100
because we throw exceptions for calling any of the

33
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,970
functions except for the constructor. And one

34
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,830
more file. Create SunshineAuthenticatorService. This is more code

35
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,170
that is written for us. It allows

36
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,260
the account manager to access the empty authenticator

37
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:03,430
that we just pasted in. Now we add the account type in our strings.xml. The

38
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,920
account type string suggests that it is specific

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,820
to our app. If we had many applications

40
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,400
using the same account, we might want

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,610
to create just an example.com account. We'll also

42
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,140
begin to clean things up and add

43
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,370
a content authority string. Note that this matches

44
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,390
our content provider string. We'll fix the XML file later so they both use

45
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,081
this same string. We create a new XML resource file, filename

46
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:34,950
authenticator.xml, with root element account-authenticator.

47
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,620
And you probably noticed that SunshineAuthenticatorService is

48
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,680
actually a service that needs to be registered

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,810
with a package manager in AndroidManifest.xml. Here's

50
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,940
some more pasty goodness that does just that.

51
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,770
Now be very, very careful. These strings

52
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,790
all have to match precisely. The error messages

53
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,610
that the system gives for having incorrect accounts

54
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,960
are not necessarily intuitive. And with that you

55
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,120
should be able to create valid accounts. Once again,

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,530
this is all just so that the SyncAdapter can be

57
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,350
tied to an account. You don't actually use this

58
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,052
at all. All right, let's tweak our provider tag in

59
00:03:12,052 --> 00:03:15,410
the manifest. We're going to add the syncable attribute.

60
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,720
This just lets Android know that we're planning to synchronize

61
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,799
the content provider with the server. Also, we'll set

62
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,220
android:exported equals false. We had it at the default setting.

63
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,750
Which means that other apps could see our content. Finally,

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,530
let's change the authority to use our new string. Now

65
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,930
for some additional permissions. We need to be able to

66
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,790
read and write sync settings. That makes sense. We also

67
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,810
have to authenticate accounts, even though we're not really using

68
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,420
them for anything. None of these permissions are ones users

69
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,530
should be concerned about. But as developers, we always want

70
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,780
to be careful when we have to add new permissions.

71
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,780
Let's create the SunshineSyncAdapter file itself inside

72
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,610
of sync, which extends the abstract threaded sync

73
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,683
adapter class. Hit Ctrl+I and then Ctrl+O

74
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:04,900
to implement the necessary abstract methods in constructor.

75
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,170
We'll use the first constructor. We'll fill

76
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,330
this out later. As you may recall, the

77
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,650
sync adaptor pattern requires yet another service. So

78
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,645
we're going to create another Java class called SunshineSyncService.

79
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,670
This class is used to deliver the sync adapter Binder to the sync manager.

80
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,690
The Binder is implemented for us by

81
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,520
the abstract threaded sync adapter class. And returned

82
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,560
in the getSyncAdapterBinder method. And now, we

83
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,750
need one more XML file. Create syncadapter.xml with

84
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,120
root element sync-adapter. Once again, this XML

85
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,590
file defines the settings associated with our sync-adapter.

86
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,290
Including it's content authority. The account type that it

87
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,890
syncs. Whether or not it's user visible. Whether it

88
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,180
supports uploading, which changes the way the content provider

89
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,280
interacts with the sync adapter. Allowing parallel syncs and is

90
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,400
always syncable. These settings make sense for this particular

91
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,350
application, and I bet you know what comes next. You're

92
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,100
right. You have to register the sync adapter service

93
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,140
with the package manager. And therefore we have to create

94
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,540
more manifest entries, containing some important metadata. Most

95
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,602
importantly, links to the file we just created. All

96
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:19,040
right, now we're getting close. Let's start working

97
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,690
on the sync adapter, itself. We'll start with a

98
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,820
helper function to get the dummy sync account

99
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,760
and make sure that it has been created. Then,

100
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,560
we'll add another helper function to our sync adaptor,

101
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,510
to make it easier to test our sync adaptor.
