1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,010
All right, you're done. Let's look at the solution.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,090
As I said in the question, we're going to be

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,720
working inside a forecast fragment in the update weather function.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,220
First, we're going to need to create a standard intent

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,650
for our alarm receiver. We then add our location query

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,920
as an extra. We then wrap that in a pending

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,440
intent. A pending intent is a special kind of object

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,838
that describes an intent. This allows other applications to implement

9
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:28,060
the feature of the original intent that's used to

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,880
create the pending intent. We're only going to use this

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,542
pending intent once, so I set flag one shot.

12
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:37,480
Then, we get the alarm service and set the alarm

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,900
to trigger five seconds from now. But we still

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,100
need for our alarm to do something. Back in the

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,990
Broadcast Receiver, we need to send the standard intent

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,070
to start our service, and that's it. Let's try running

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,460
the app. All right, so now we've got the

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,460
Alarm Manager getting in the way of our service. We

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,760
hit refresh. It'll take us about five more seconds

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,660
before we actually see the data now. And there we

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,930
have it. A very, very simple alarm. Even with

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,820
this updating in the background potentially, and using a service,

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,170
we could still be more efficient in our use

24
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,730
of phone resources. Rato can tell us more about that.
