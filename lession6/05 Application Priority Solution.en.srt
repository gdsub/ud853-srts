1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,040
That's right. Maps isn't visible or running any

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,625
services, so it's the most likely to be killed.

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:08,290
G-mail is running a service, but it's not interacting

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,790
directly with the user while Google Music and the

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,870
camera app are. Of those two, the Music app

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,690
must have been in the foreground for longer than

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,980
the camera. So it's got a slightly lower priority,

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,310
though neither are in any danger of being killed.
