00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,070
One of the most powerful features of Android, since the

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,550
start of the platform has been the ability to deliver

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,100
timely notifications to users. We're going to add a simple

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,480
one to our weather app. This simple notification will show the

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,730
weather icon for the forecast, the forecast text, and the

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,420
high and low temperature for the day. One of the key

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,870
things we wanted to point out is how not to

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,920
be spammy with our notification. Our app will display at most

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,080
a single notification. It really wouldn't make sense if these

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,120
notifications stacked up anyhow. They don't display enough information to

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,250
give context. The key thing with notifications is to deliver

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,970
a useful morsel of information, formatted in a standard way, so

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,760
that it harmonizes with the rest of the system. We'll

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,440
start by adding a string for the preference for the

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,140
last time we sent a notification to the user. As

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,210
well as a format string for the body of the notification.

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,610
Let's implement the notification inside of our sync adapter.

18
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,670
Our notification will be based upon what is in

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,100
the database. So, we'll create projection and column indices

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,110
value in our sync adapter, for the weather id. Description,

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,320
max and then temperature, let's add a function to

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,020
notify us of the weather. We'll add some additional

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,430
constants up here. One for day in mili's and

24
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,220
one so that we an use the same notification ID.

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,060
Reusing the notification ID means that our application will only

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,260
post at most one notification. And then finally, we'll call

27
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,750
this function at a reasonable place within our on perform

28
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,540
sync function within our sync adapter. Inside of notify weather, we'll

29
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,761
check to see whether or not, we've actually shown notification

30
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:36,010
that day. If we haven't, then we'll talk to the database.

31
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,140
Get a cursor for the current resolver for the current

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,320
day, and then fetch the data, but one thing were not

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,770
doing is actually showing the notification. Now all right, were getting near

34
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,970
the end. Implement a weather notification,

35
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,380
build our notification using Notification Compat.builder

36
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,910
pointing to a Pending Intent built by the v4 compatible. TaskStackBuilder and

37
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,770
sent with the NotificationManager. Hint: an

38
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,860
explicit intent to our main activity is

39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,280
a good idea here. There's lots of documentation on this you'll want to read.
