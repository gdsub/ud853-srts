00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,270
There's a number of reasons you'd be potentially better

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,180
off breaking your app into different activities. Having a

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,760
single monolithic activity increases the complexity of your code,

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,370
making the creation and management of intent filters much

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,470
harder and making it more difficult to maintain, test,

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,740
and read your activity code. It also increases the

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,660
risk of tightly coupling independent components and makes it

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,190
much more likely to introduce security risks if the

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,150
single activity includes both sensitive information and information that's safe

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,650
to share. A good rule of thumb is to create a

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,260
new activity whenever the context changes. For example, displaying a

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,530
different kind of data, while switching from viewing to entering data.
