00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,640
The Nexus One has a 3.7 inch screen, and the Nexus 5, a 4.9 inch display, so

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,560
they both fall comfortably within the normal range

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,190
for screen size. The Nexus One has a screen

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,110
density of 252 dpi, which is hdpi, whereas

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,370
the Nexus 5, which was released three years after

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,880
the Nexus One, has a much higher screen

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,910
density, 445 dots per inch. That makes it xxhdpi.
