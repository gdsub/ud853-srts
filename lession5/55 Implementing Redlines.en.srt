1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,670
It's time to implement the red lines for the main activity. We

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,939
can do one part together so that you get the hang of it.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,640
We begin by styling the list item Forecast Layout. The red line specifies

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,240
that the image should be 32 dp by 32 dp. We could hard

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,100
code the image view to be 32 by 32 dp, but it's actually

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,330
the same as leaving it as wrapped content for height and width. To

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,970
know what the icon size would be if we wrap content, we open

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,370
up the MDPI version of the icon and we do verify that it

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,450
is 32 pixels by 32 pixels. Whether we hard code it

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,400
or just add wrap content, visually, the imagine will still look

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,310
the same, but in the future it will be more flexible

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,210
if we just specify wrap content in case the image size changes.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,150
Next we style the text. On ice cream sandwich and above,

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,060
Roboto is the default font for text views. It is created

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,310
specifically to satisfy the requirements of UI and to optimize for

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,510
high density screens. The red line indicates that the font family is

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,130
Roboto sans serif condensed, so we add that to the

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,240
code. On the topic of font sizes, having too many font

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,820
sizes in your app can confuse your user about the visual

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,540
hierarchy of your app, as to what's important and what's not

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,110
important. The Android design guide recommends these four type sizes

22
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,800
for consistency with a platform and for user experience. In our

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,710
app, we stick to the standard type sizes. And that's an

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,540
intentional part of the design, such as the large temperature values.

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,750
Hence, when the red line say that the date text

26
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,100
should be 22sp for font size, we could specify Android

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,420
text size to be 22sp, but the text appearance large

28
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,210
attribute already maps to that value. Note that the font

29
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,520
sizes are specified in S-P, not dips. S-P stands for

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,130
scaled pixels, so you can scale with the device font

31
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,771
size. In our app, we specify text appearance large and

32
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:41,090
text appearance small, which will give up 22spand 14sp respectively.

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,880
The default font color is black, so we don't need to specify

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,110
the android text color attribute on our text views. Let's look at the

35
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,790
spacing for the elements within the list item now. We have three children.

36
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,680
The first one is 60 dp wide, with the image centered inside of

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,124
it. So we can add a frame layout around the image view

38
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:58,601
and set the gravity to be center on the image, that way the

39
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:02,695
image centers itself within the parent. For the other two columns, we shouldn't

40
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:06,150
hard code such high dp values. Because otherwise the layout won't scale across

41
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,650
other devices. Instead, we can use linear layout weights, the weight of

42
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,610
seven here, and the weight of five. We just tried different values

43
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,390
until we got approximately equal to these values. The trick in doing

44
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,490
red lines is that you want to match the visual specs, but

45
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,910
you also want to be flexible in the code, so that it

46
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,840
adapts to different screen sizes. And this is what the code looks

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,770
like for the list_items_forecast layout. We

48
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,930
have a horizontal linear layout, containing

49
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,530
the frame layout with the image view. Then we have a vertical

50
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,050
linear layout with weight seven. And then we have another vertical layout

51
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,620
with weight five. We can check the link below for the full

52
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,650
code file. This is what is looks like when you're done. These

53
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,110
items looks polished, but we haven't gotten to the today item yet.
