00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,770
Now that you know how to create an

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,410
arbitrarily complex nested layout, it's important to understand

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,109
that they don't come for free. Once again,

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,965
the resource constraints of the platform spoil the party.

5
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:15,351
[SOUND] Inflating complex layouts can be expensive, potentially

6
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:19,427
impacting the performance and responsiveness of your app.

7
00:00:19,427 --> 00:00:21,765
So there are two good rules of thumb

8
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:25,620
to help. First, keep your layout shallow and wide,

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,930
rather than deep and narrow. That means you're better

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,490
off with more siblings and fewer children. Because it's

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,970
never as simple as that, you also want to

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,930
avoid having excessive views. In the most general terms, that

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,430
means your activities' full hierarchy should never have more

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,450
than ten nested views or over 80 views in

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,590
total. That probably sounds like a lot, but let's

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,350
open up the Hierarchy Viewer tool in Android studio and

17
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,170
see just how quickly that can add up
