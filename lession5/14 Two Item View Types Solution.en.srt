new view method to choose layout ID based on

00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,080
view type. If the view type is today then

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,880
we use this resource ID. This points to the

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,430
layout xml file list item forecast today. If the

00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,350
list type is for a future day, then we

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,380
use this resource ID. This points to the list

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,680
item forecast layout xml. Then we inflate that layout.
