00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,070
Now let's take this opportunity to go ahead and create our

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,960
own custom view. And we don't need one in particular for

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,320
sunshine, so you can go ahead and choose anything. Personally, I'm

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,240
a fan of compass control, so that's what I've been building. You'll

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,820
need to include three constructors to support your view being created

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,660
in code through a resource or through inflation, then simply override the

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,550
onMeasure method and set your dimensions. Click here when you're done,

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,280
and, you're ready to get started drawing the contents of your gear.
