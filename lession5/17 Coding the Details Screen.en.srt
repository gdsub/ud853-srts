1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,840
You've implemented the main activity wireframe. So, now, we can move

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,800
on to the detail activity wireframe. This is what it looks

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,440
like. We have the date, the high and low temperatures, and

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,690
then additional weather information. We also have the weather icon and

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,870
the weather forecast. And these line up horizontally. Build up the

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,020
layout XML for this wireframe. Then modify the detail fragments that

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,640
you can populate all this information, including these new views. While

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,220
you're doing that, you might as well move the detail fragment

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,550
into its own file, so it's separate from the detail activity. At

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,380
this point the detail fragment class is getting pretty long so you can

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,450
move that into it its own file. Before you get started, I want

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,530
to point out that this layout has information taking up a lot of

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,270
vertical space. If you rotate your device into landscape mode, or you have

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,350
a smaller height device, some of the content could get cut off. So

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,720
think about how you can make this layout be vertically scrollable. To show

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,280
you what I mean, I added a couple more lines of text at

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,240
the bottom of the layout. Then I made the content vertically scrollable

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,930
so you can see all the information. So go ahead and make that

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,340
change to your layout as well. When you're done with all these

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,910
steps, this is what the app should look like. We don't care about

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,000
the visual details now. We just want to make sure the functionality is

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,210
hooked up, so all the right information is displayed on screen. You can

23
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,930
use the code snippets provided below

24
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,860
for helper functions and strings that you're

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,520
going to need. And again, leaving a placeholder image is fine for now
