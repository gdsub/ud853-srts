00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,730
I've mentioned the FragmentManager, FragmentTransactions in the back stack

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,410
a few times. Now, take a look at the documentation

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,370
on the Android developer site, and complete the code,

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,990
which will replace the contents of the fragment container with

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,550
a new instance of the details fragment. Keep in

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,060
mind that this transaction should allow the user to reverse

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,460
the transaction using the Back button. And in this

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,990
case, we'll be calling this code from within an activity.
