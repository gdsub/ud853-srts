00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,380
As you know, there's always more changes that we wish

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,873
we could do, if we just had a little more time.

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:08,458
We're going to leave those as exercises to you, if you want to

4
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:12,200
keep polishing up. For example, for simplicity, we had all tablet

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,434
sizes and orientations use the same layout. However, 7 inch portrait

6
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,273
would actually look better as a one pin UI. So you

7
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:22,768
can modify your resource folders to make 7 inch portrait use

8
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,220
the phone layout. You can also tweak the two pane behavior

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,200
so that the today layout is auto selected when you first launch the

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,420
app. Also, this should just say today instead of having the full date. That

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,880
way, it'll look more like the other items. As you play around with the

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
app, feel free to make changes you think would help improve the user experience.
