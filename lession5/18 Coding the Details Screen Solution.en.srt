1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,420
So how did you break up the UI into smaller components?

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,730
Well, you might have thought that this could be two columns, but

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,080
then it would be hard to position the elements here. You

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,140
could center them vertically within the height of the screen, but it

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,820
wouldn't necessarily line up with the temperature views on the left-hand

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,980
side. Instead, this looks more like a horizontal linear layout. Then, the

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,660
rest of the elements could be laid out by using a vertical

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,410
linear layout. The vertical linear layout would have six children. The third

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,460
element would be a horizontal linear layout, composed of two children.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,685
The first would be another vertical linear layout with these two texts

11
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:35,680
views, and the second element would be another vertical linear layout

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,540
composed of these two 2 elements. To make the contents of the

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,520
screen vertically scrollable, we put it inside a scroll view. Using

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,090
a list view here would be overkill, because we don't need to

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,310
scale to an infinite number of item and we don't need recycling.

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,730
There's a fixed number of fields on the screen, so a scroll

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,800
view is the perfect choice. I can show you our implementation for

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,165
the fragment detail XML layout. We hard coded some data in the

19
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:59,270
layout, so that it would show up as a preview in the

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,160
Design Pane. At the root of the View hierarchy, we have a Scroll

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,680
View. Scroll Views can only have max one child. So we set

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,050
that to be the vertical linear layout. Inside of this layout, we have

23
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,960
a text view for the day of the week, the calendar date,

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,000
and then a horizontal linear layout. This is followed by the humidity text

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,320
view, wind text view and pressure text view. In the XML

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,200
code, we see the scroll view with the trial linear layout. We

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,830
give it some padding of 16dp, so that the content does

28
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,660
not flush up against the edge of the screen. Then we see

29
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,510
the text views followed by the horizontal linear layout. We specify

30
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,050
layout margin top of 16dp to give it some more space from

31
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,090
the bottom of this text view. Within this horizontal linear layout, we

32
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,290
have one vertical linear layout which has a width of zero and

33
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,980
a weight of one. And another linear layout with the

34
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,170
width at zero and a weight of one. That means that

35
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,690
both of these children have equal width. For this linear layout,

36
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,980
we specified gravity to be center horizontal. That means that the

37
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,670
contents inside of it will be centered horizontally, which includes

38
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,850
the icon, as well as the forecast text view. Lastly, we

39
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,180
have the remaining text views for the other weather details. When

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,330
the layout looks good, we update the detail fragment. At this

41
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,184
point, we also move it into its own file. In the

42
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:11,950
onload finish method, we used to have a lot of Find You

43
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,770
by ID calls. However, we can cash those views earlier so that

44
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,230
we only have to fetch them once. In the onCreateView method, once

45
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,560
the view is inflated, we can go and find a reference

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,420
to all the views we'll need later. We store these views as

47
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,640
member variables in a class. Which is why they start with the

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,450
letter M. In the onCreateLoaded method, we make sure that the projection

49
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,930
that we're requesting from the content provider contains all the information

50
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,200
that we need. Especially the new fields that we just added views

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,960
for. Then in the onload Finish method, we get the cursor

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,920
back with the data we need. We read the weather condition ID

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,610
from the cursor. And we're going to need this later to determine

54
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,500
the right icon. But for now, we can just use a placeholder

55
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,990
icon. We continue reading from the cursor and updating the views such

56
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,670
as for the date and description and temperatures. For the new views

57
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,360
for humidity, wind, and pressure, we read the

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,860
information from the cursor, and then we format it

59
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,680
properly for the UI. This involved copying over

60
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,520
the strings and the utility method from the gist.
