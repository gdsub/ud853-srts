1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,030
In the adaptor bindView method, we have to traverse the view

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,990
hierarchy to find all these different views to set data onto

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,090
them. If it's a recycled view, meaning that it was used

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,030
in the list previously to display other data, we still have

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,252
to traverse and find all the views. To remove unnecessary find

6
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:18,520
View By ID calls, we can use the View Holder pattern.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,280
For a list item layout that contains different views, we can

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,350
create a View Holder object. It contains member variables that reference each

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,040
view in the layout. The View Holder object is stored in

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,030
the tag field of the view. The next time that the view

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,960
is recycled and used again. We can just immediately set the data

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,180
onto these fields. You don't have to go find all the views

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,130
again. This is our View Holder class. You can name it anything

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,046
you want, it's just a Java class. Given the list item layout,

15
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,220
we do all the find view by ID calls. That way, we

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,705
can hold references to all the child views. In the newView method,

17
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:54,080
after we've inflated the view, we create a new View Holder object

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,340
from that view. Then we set the View Holder as the tag of

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,100
the view. The tag can be used to store any object. But

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,530
don't abuse it, because when you read it back, you have to know

21
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,858
what you stored in there. A View Holder is a good use

22
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:08,470
case for it. Then in the bindView method. We read from the tag,

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,670
to get back the View Holder object. And we immediately have references, to

24
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,260
all the individual views we need to update, such as the Icon View,

25
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,670
the Date View, the Description View etc. Go ahead and define a View

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,030
Holder class and update your adapter to use it. When you compile and

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,780
run, you may not see that noticeable of a difference. But now your

28
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,780
list will perform better when it scales to hundreds or thousands of items.
