1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,160
So, we need to build an app that adapts well to

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,360
all different devices. But there's so many types of devices. So,

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,680
where do we begin? Well, we can start by grouping them

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,930
into buckets based on physical size. We can have a bucket for

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,390
phones and a bucket for seven inch tablets. And a bucket

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,320
for ten inch tablets as well. You can go even more granular

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,060
based on screen width. But these are the most common buckets

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,260
that you'll need. Now, classifying based on size alone is not enough.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,950
Even among devices of the same size, there's still

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,870
a wide range of screen densities. Screen density is calculated

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,270
from the number of dots per inch on the device

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,990
or DPI. Scale starts off with low density devices, also

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,120
known as LDPI devices. It has about 120 dots

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,870
per inch, then it increases to medium density, high density

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,960
all the way to extra, extra, extra high density devices

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,400
were the number of dots per inch is much higher.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,260
So, how do we build an app that accounts for

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,390
all these different screen densities? Well, when we specify layout dimensions,

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,590
we quickly realize that we can't use pixels. For example,

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,360
a 48 pixel button that looks fine on an MDPI device

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,810
will look much smaller on a higher density device where

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,180
the pixels are more compacted and the physical size of 48

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,870
pixels is much smaller. The user wants a button to be

24
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,220
easily tappable, and so it shouldn't change based on screen density.

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,970
So we need a consistent unit of measure to define physical

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,610
size, and in Android we call that density-independent pixels or dips

27
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,460
or dp for short. That way, a 48 dp button will

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,750
be the same physical size across all these different screen densities.
