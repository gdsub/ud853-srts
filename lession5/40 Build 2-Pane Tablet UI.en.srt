1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,670
By taking the knowledge that we learned about overriding

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,140
the resources in the other folders we'll walk through the

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,911
code together on how to build up the two-pane tablet

4
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:11,800
UI. First remove the values w820dp folder because we don't

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,790
need to provide specific logic for where the current

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,930
orientation is greater than 820 dp. Then go ahead and

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,265
make the layout XML changes. Then create a new layout

8
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:25,620
swe600dp folder, and then add a new file called activity_main.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,070
We use the same file and name as in

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,520
the base layout folder activity_main, so that this one

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,140
overrides the behavior, specifically on tablets. To see the

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,849
code for this file, you can check out the gist

13
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:41,320
below. Essentially it's a horizontal linear layout that can

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,880
hold forecast fragment on the left, and the detail fragment

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,120
on the right. Now's a good time to talk

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,970
about static versus dynamic fragments. In our implementation, the forecast

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,940
fragment is a static fragment because we're defining it the XML

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,980
layout. No matter what orientation or device size, we know that

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,550
we're going to need a forecast fragment in the main activity. On

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,776
the other hand, we only need to declare a container for

21
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:06,080
the detail fragment, but not the actual fragment. It's initialized with

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,440
different arguments each time, as a dynamic fragment, so it's better

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,820
to dynamically create and add that fragment in a fragment transaction

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,030
in the main activity Java code. That way the fragment manager

25
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,800
can keep track of those initialization arguments and pass those

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,750
back to us after device rotation. Then we need to update

27
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,820
the one pane UI layouts so that they are consistent with

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,840
the two pane case. So in the activity_main file for the

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,820
base layout folder, this used to be a frame layout. We're

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,640
going to declare it as a forecast fragment, that way it will

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,160
match the two pin UI where this is also declared as

32
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,120
a fragment in the XML. That way the main activity never

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,740
has to worry about dynamically adding the forecast fragment.

34
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,540
And the main activity onCreate view method, since the

35
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,930
fragment is already inside this layout we can just

36
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,370
remove this so we don't dynamically add it again. Similar,

37
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,660
we've modified the activity_detail layout in the base layout

38
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,510
folder. We change the frame that ID, to be

39
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,340
weather detail container; so that it matches the container

40
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,130
view ID in the two pane UI case,. The pattern

41
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,220
here is that the detail fragment will always be

42
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,770
added to a container called weather_detail_container, both in the two

43
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,710
pane and one pane case. Since we changed the name

44
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,120
of the container we should also update the DetailActivity. This

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,500
is only used in one pane mode. Here's where we

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,055
change the container name. In the one pane mode, the

47
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:28,580
DetailActivity will add the DetailFragment, dynamically to this container. After

48
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,650
we modify the layout we should update the main activities,

49
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,527
that we dynamically add the DetailFragment. In the MainActivity

50
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:39,250
onCreate method, we check for the presence of the weather_detail_container

51
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,350
in the layout to know whether this is a two

52
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,360
pane UI or not. We keep track of this information

53
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,490
in a bullion called mTwoPane. Remember that we start with

54
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,020
the letter M because it's a member variable. In this

55
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,480
case, the bullion should be true. So we go ahead

56
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,570
and create a DetailFragment and add it to the weather_detail_container.

57
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,690
We commit the change by using a fragment transaction, which

58
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,120
Rato introduced earlier. Otherwise, if the detail container is not

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,320
present in the layout, then the boolean should be false,

60
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,210
meaning that this is a one pane UI for phones.

61
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,830
In this case, the detail activity will handle showing the

62
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,080
detail fragment. Notice for the two pane case that we

63
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,060
check, if the savedInstanceState bundle is null. If the savedInstanceState

64
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,830
bundle is not null, then we don't create a new one.

65
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,170
And here's the reason why. Say, you want to rotate

66
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,760
the device. Before the activity and fragments get torn down,

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,070
we store information in saved state bundles. Then after the

68
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,220
orientation change, the system restores the activity and the fragments

69
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,480
by passing back the same bundle so that it can

70
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,560
be re-created with the same state. That means if the

71
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,670
bundle exists then we should let the system handle restoring

72
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,840
the detail fragment and we can skip this code. Once the

73
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,260
detail fragment is added dynamically make it show some placeholder

74
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,910
data just for testing purposes. Later we'll plumb through the right

75
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,580
logic so that it can display the right information for

76
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,060
the selected date on the left. Modify the DetailFragment so that

77
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,800
it doesn't expect the incoming intent to have the DATE_KEY.

78
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,320
In this case it doesn't start the loader, which is fine,

79
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,730
and it just falls back to some placeholder data that we

80
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,310
have in our XML. The same goes for the onResume method.

81
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,670
We don't restart the loader if the intent is blank.

82
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,550
The reason the Intent could be blank, is because the detail

83
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,360
fragment can now exist within the main activity. So the main

84
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,650
activity doesn't have the same Intent key, that the DetailActivity was

85
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,060
launched with. Once you make the changes for the wireframes,

86
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,050
this is what the app should look like. The reason it

87
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,680
doesn't show an icon here is because we removed the icon

88
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,810
from being hardcoded in the layout. But once this data's populated

89
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,290
dynamically in a later section, it should show up again.
