1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,680
Beto mentioned that we should provide bit maps at different resolutions.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,700
In our app, the 48 dib icon on the Nexus S

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,910
looks to be about the same size as on the Nexus

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,830
4, and on the Nexus 5. However, in reality, this asset

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,360
that's being displayed is actually a lot bigger in terms of

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,540
pixels compared to this one. To confirm, we can check out

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,940
the app resource folders. In the drawable folders, we see that

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,320
our app has a 48 by 48 pixel launcher icon for

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,068
mdpi devices located in the drawable mdpi folder. To

10
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:31,900
make an equivalent icon for the higher density devices,

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,780
we need to make that icon progressively larger. To

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,390
know exactly how big to make these images and

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,370
what the dibbed pixel conversion should be, we use

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,270
an mdpi device as the baseline. This is where

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,573
one dib equals one pixel. Then on the HDPI

16
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:50,793
device one dib equals 1.5 pixels. And then it increases

17
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:53,030
from there, all the way to an xx HDPI

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,570
device, where one dib equals four pixels. For more info

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,121
on the conversions, see the link below. Following those

20
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,461
rules, these are the sizes of the launcher icon in

21
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,319
our drawable folders. The MDPI one is 48 pixels

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,250
by 48 pixels. The one for HDPI is 1.5 times

23
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,360
the size of this one. From an XHDPI device,

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,970
the icon is two times the size of the MDPI

25
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,340
one, and for an XXHDPI device, the icon is the three times the size of this one.
