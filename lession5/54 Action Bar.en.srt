1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,450
Earlier, we learned about styles and how you can apply them

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,420
to an individual View. If you want to apply it to

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,270
all of the views in an activity or application, you can

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,330
do it by specifying a theme attribute on the activity or

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,620
application tag in the Android manifest. Now we style the action

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,820
bar to look like these visual mocks. This is the settings,

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,040
detail and main activity. For all cases, we want the background

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,220
color to be this blue hex color. Then we notice that the

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,300
styling of the settings and detail activities look very similar.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,070
They both have the app icon and the activity title. On

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,670
the other hand, main activity just shows the logo. It's a

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,740
different attribute than the app icon, and this was provided in

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,840
asset drop earlier and it's called ic_logo. Because of these similarities,

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,530
we can use the same theme for these two activities and

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,700
we can create a new theme for the main activity. In

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,450
the case of our app, we use app theme here and

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,050
we use forecast theme here. We customize the themes in

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,480
the styles file in the base values folder. The app

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,140
theme inherits from the dark action bar system theme but

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,040
we override the action bar style to be our own.

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,480
This is defined here. We give it a parent ActionBar

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,135
style, and then we specify the background to be the

23
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,970
sunshine_blue color. Remember that this will be used in the

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,480
settings activity and the detail activity. Then for the main

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,500
activity, we declare the ForecastTheme. We inherit from the AppTheme, in

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,370
case there's more attributes that got added here, and then we'll be

27
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,990
able to inherit it for free. But we override the action bar

28
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,110
style to be this one. We set the logo because that's displayed

29
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,220
in the main activity, and we set the display options so

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,880
that we can show the logo. For more information on the action

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,790
bar display options, you can see the list here. For backward compatibility,

32
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,680
we needed to find these action bar styles in the base values

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,220
folder as well in the values V14 folder. The action bar compact class in the

34
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,570
support library handles action bar behavior up

35
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,070
through honeycomb. And then for ice cream sandwich

36
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,760
and above, it goes through the framework

37
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,150
implementation of the action bar. You can see

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,610
the code for the two files below. Go ahead and make these two changes now.
