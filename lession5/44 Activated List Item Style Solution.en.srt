1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,240
From the documentation, we want singleChoice, mode so

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,080
that the list item only shows one selected item at a time.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,540
You can declare this attribute on the list view in the fragment_main file.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,920
However, we don't want to specify ChoiceMode in one ping mode. So, to

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,860
have these different code paths, we could copy the file in the Layout folder and

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,870
put it in the Layout and put it in the Layout-sw600dp folder.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,460
A better solution is to declare a style. So, we have one layout file but

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,281
different styles. In the Base styles file in the values folder,

9
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:30,580
we declare ForecastListStyle. We leave it empty because we don't need to

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,640
specify ChoiceMode. We create a new styles file in the values-sw600dp folder.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,390
In the two pane case, the ForecastListStyle does include the ChoiceMode.

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,840
The two files have a different number of styles. If it's not declared in

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,410
a higher folder, then it will just fall back to the Base style.
