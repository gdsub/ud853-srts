1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,516
In the Forecast Fragment class, we add the callback

2
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:06,020
that was provided in the gist. Then in the onCreateView

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,200
method, we modify the item click behavior. When an

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,660
item is clicked, we move the cursor to that position

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,060
and then we read out the date string. We

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,300
call getActivity and then we cast it to a Callback

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,410
object. And then we call onItemSelected, with that date

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,450
string. Then in the MainActivity, we implement this Callback interface.

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,700
In the onItemSelected method, we fork behavior based on

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,530
the TwoPane variable that we defined earlier. If we're

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,650
in TwoPane mode, then we create a new DetailFragment

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,180
using the date in the arguments bundle. And then

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,420
we replace the existing fragment in the weather_detail_container. Otherwise,

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,900
in OnePane mode, we create a new intent to

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,500
launch the detail activity setting the date as an

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,720
intent extra. In the detail activity, we modify the onCreate

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,950
method to read the intent extras from the intent that

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,840
came from the main activity. We take this date and set

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,700
it in the arguments bundle to initialize the detail fragment.

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,500
And we dynamically add the detail fragment to this container. In

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,730
the detail fragment, we modify the on create loader method

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,710
to read from the arguments that were passed in. We get

23
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,270
the date string out and use it with the location

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,760
string to build up the Uri to query the content provider.

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,790
We also remove any reliance on the incoming intent.

26
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,480
We switch it to use the arguments bundle, instead. For

27
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,220
example, in the onActivityCreated method, we only initialize the loader

28
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,620
if the arguments is not null. In the onResume method,

29
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,060
we also modify the condition so that it checks that

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,520
the arguments bundle is not null. When you try it

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,990
out on the tablet, there is one bug related to

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,810
navigation that we should fix. Say we select tomorrows date.

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,210
If you navigate to the settings activity and then hit

34
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,980
the up button, the detail fragment is blank. That's because

35
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,840
a brand new instance of main activity got launched and

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,880
for a brand new instance, nothing is selected yet. To fix

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,170
this, when the settings activity up button is pressed, we

38
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,690
want to navigate to the previous running instance of the

39
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,370
main activity, where the tomorrow item is selected. And not

40
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,600
create a new instance of main activity. In the settings activity,

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,620
overwrite this method. Which the system will call in

42
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,430
order to get the parent activity intent for the up

43
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,310
button behaviour. Get the parent activity intent from the

44
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,160
super class, this should create a new intent to main

45
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,500
activity. Then add the intent flag, called FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP. This

46
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,080
flag indicates that we should check if the main activity

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,400
is already running in our task. And to use

48
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,890
that one, instead of creating a new main activity instance.

49
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,730
Also, this method didn't exist prior to jelly bean, so we need

50
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,120
to add this at target API annotation. If you check the documentation

51
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,240
for the activity class, the getParentActivityIntent method was only added in API

52
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,110
level 16. And you can check that version 16 maps to jelly bean.
