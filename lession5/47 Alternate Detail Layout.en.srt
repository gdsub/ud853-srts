We're not quite done yet, with implementing the tablet UI wire

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,020
frames. The detail fragment should look like this, but instead it

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,110
looks more like this. For the tablet UI, we try to

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,880
optimize it more, for wider screens like tablet landscape mode. Another

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,340
good place for this layout, is in the phone landscape view,

00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,120
where there's more horizontal space, than vertical space. For this quiz,

00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,820
figure out which layout folders, we would need to define the

00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,350
fragment detail layout in. In order to achieve this layout on phone

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,010
