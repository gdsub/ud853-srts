1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,070
Once a forecast adapter works, we want to modify it so

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,420
that it can return a second item view type for the

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,377
today list item. Normally in the sub class, getViewTypeCount return to

4
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:12,033
one, but we're going to override it so it returns two for

5
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:14,930
the two different layouts. But how does it know when to

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,180
use one there or the other? Well, we override getItemViewType so

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,530
that when the position in the list is zero, then we

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,790
say that it's the TODAY view type. Otherwise, it's the FUTURE_DAY

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,430
view type. These two view types are declared up

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,659
above. These are just integer representations of the view type.

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,320
The numbering has to start at zero because these values

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,880
can not be greater than or equal to getViewTypeCount. So,

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,870
the possible values for us are zero and one,

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,435
so that we know that zero always maps to the

15
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:47,780
view_type_today and that one always maps to view_type_future_day. We're going to

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,790
use this information in the new View method. Remember that

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,670
previously we inflated the list_item_forecast.xml. Now, we're going to use

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,280
the getItemViewType to determine whether we should use one

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,210
layout or the other. Fill in the to do

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,170
to address this behavior. LayoutId refers to resource ID,

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,890
which is in the form of r.layout.something. We don't

22
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,780
have to reform the bindView method because it will

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,580
continue to work. That's because the IDs are the

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,040
same between the today layout and the future day layout.

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,490
This is what your app should look like when you're

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,020
done. The today layout is different from the rest of the

27
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,760
days. Go ahead and make these changes in your app and

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,400
then finish the To Do. Check this box when you're done.
