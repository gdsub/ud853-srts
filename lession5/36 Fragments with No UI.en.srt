00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,650
The final advantage of fragments, doesn't involve user interfaces at

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,505
all. As you know, as visual components, activities are destroyed and

3
00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:10,970
re-created, whenever the device configuration changes. Most notably, when the

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,200
screen orientation switches. That makes sense, because there's a good chance

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,200
we'll want to create a different layout, to better suit the

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,000
new configuration. But if we can use fragments to break up

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,340
visual activity modules, and find out logical ones as well,

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,270
it turns out we can do exactly that. And because these

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,770
fragments are non-visual, there's no need to recreate them

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,640
every time the UI needs updating. Within the onCreate

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,640
handler of your non-UI fragment, call setRetainInstance, passing in

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,220
true, and return null in your onCreate view handler.

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,550
Then, once the parent activity is created, you can

14
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,180
kick off any connections, threads, or tasks that are

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,520
bound to the lifetime of the activity, which don't

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,750
need to be interrupted every time the device rotates.
