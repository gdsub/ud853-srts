00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,600
When we were learning that response in design, we saw that

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,360
a common pattern was to use the master detail flow, which

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,410
is what were going to use for sunshine. Here are the

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,580
tablet mocks. We have a list of forecasts on the left, and

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,220
then for the selected item, we see the detail pane on

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,080
the right. This applies for a seven inch and ten inch tablets.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,380
Both portrait and landscape orientations. In portrait mode, the columns are

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,670
just a little bit narrower, but it's still a two pane UI.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,220
In terms of implementation, all of this will be under the

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,020
main activity. Then on the left, we have the forecast fragment.

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,070
And then on the right, we have the detail fragment. On

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,846
the phone, we would still have the main activity with the list

13
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:39,580
of forecast. And then selecting an item would still launch the

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,480
detail activity. Here's another way to visualize it. On the tablet, we

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,630
have two fragments side by side under one activity. And then

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,030
on the phone, we have the first activity containing the first fragment.

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,080
Selecting an item will launch the second activity containing the second

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,640
fragment. We're going to break this up into multiple coding tasks until

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,140
we build up the final layout. First we'll build up the

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,460
two pane UI for tablets. Then we'll hook up the communication

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,070
between the two fragments, so that's selecting an item replaces the

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,530
detail pane on the right. Then we'll learn how to show

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,590
an activated state on the currently selected item, so we know

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,100
what the details pane corresponds to. We'll also need to make

25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,630
sure that the scroll position is maintained across

26
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,430
orientation changes. After that, we'll update the detail layout

27
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,730
so it's optimized for these wider screens. And

28
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,370
then we'll modify the adapter so that today's layout

29
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,340
looks like the other days. There's no special

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,980
today layout on the tablet. So hopefully it's clear

31
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,930
how we're going to approach implementing this tablet behavior and

32
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,660
we're going to step through it slowly, one by one
