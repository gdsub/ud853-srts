00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,440
Hurray, you're done implementing wire frames for the app! Now

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,150
comes the visual polish part, where we tweak the styles

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,950
and the views to make the app look awesome. Here

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,620
are the visual mocks, for what the app should look

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,310
like, when we're done. If you work with a designer,

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,050
they should also give you red lines. Red lines specify

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,990
everything from sizes, font styles, colors, spacing, et cetera. This

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,160
should help you achieve pixel perfect layouts that match the

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,500
visual mocks. How did we come up with these values?

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,370
Well we used the Android design guide, which has information on

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,060
metrics and grids, and we adapted them to fit our

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,920
app's needs. You can click on the link for more info.
