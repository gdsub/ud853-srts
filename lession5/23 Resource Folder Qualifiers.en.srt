1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,870
So, we know we need to create layouts

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,770
and assets optimized for different screen pixel densities

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,320
and sizes. So, now's a great time to

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,130
introduce you to the Android resource framework. All externalized

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,660
Android resources, everything from strings to layouts to

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,200
drawables and animations are all stored within your project's

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,490
res folder. You've already been putting your strings

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,500
in the strings.xml file stored in the values folder.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,550
And you've been putting your layouts into the layout

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,320
folder. And you know to reference your resources using

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,450
at notation within both your xml or within the

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,617
code. And then at runtime, Android will insert the

13
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:40,520
appropriate resource for you. So far, so good. And

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,475
here's where things get a little more interesting. Android

15
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:46,740
allows you to create alternative versions of every resource

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,040
by placing them into folders with different qualifiers. We separate

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,130
each of those using a hyphen. And we can

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,320
add those qualifiers based on anything from language and

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,640
or dialect to whether the device is docked, the

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,930
type of touch screen, the pixel density of the

21
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,820
display, the orientation of the screen, and most importantly

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,830
for a responsive design in particular, the smallest available

23
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,055
screen width which you can support with that layout.

24
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:16,270
At runtime, Android will check the count device configuration,

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,030
it's language, it's screen size, pixel density, everything,

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,790
and then load the right layout strings and drawables

27
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,410
accordingly. You can even chain these qualifiers together. For

28
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,460
example, to create a different layout for German language

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,660
users to account for all of those really long

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,960
German words, or more typically for a combination of

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,660
screen size and device configuration. Now, keep in mind

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,610
that many of these values can change at runtime.

33
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,630
The most common change being that of orientation. And

34
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,190
it's for this reason that Android activities are destroyed

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,360
and recreated whenever the device configuration changes. And that's

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,940
because the layout and all of the resources within it

37
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,880
could be completely different based on something as simple

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,640
as screen orientation change. Now it's good practice, as

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,660
well, to localize your apps and provide translated strings

40
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,720
for all of your users using this mechanism. And that's

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,530
a task made a lot easier. Thanks to Google

42
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,270
Play Publisher site that can offer you this service. It's

43
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,230
also a really good idea to provide different drawables

44
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,800
at the appropriate pixel density, so you can get a

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,440
nice crisp image on every device. And when it

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,480
comes to providing alternative layouts, Android has gone through a

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,130
few alternative models. Starting in the early days, with this

48
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,110
screen buckets idea of small, normal large, and extra large.

49
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,130
But, since Android 3.2, the new smallest width qualifier has

50
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,830
given us much more fine grain control over our layouts.
