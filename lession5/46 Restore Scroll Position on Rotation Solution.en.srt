00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,790
In the forecast fragment, we create a position variable. Whenever an item

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,234
is clicked, we update the position. Then, in the on save instance

3
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:10,230
state method, we store the position in the bundle. If the app

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,620
gets killed, then we can restore the position from the save state bundle.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,598
This is on the onCreate view method. The reason we store in

6
00:00:16,598 --> 00:00:19,573
a global variable is because the list view probably hasn't been populated

7
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:22,570
yet. We wait for the onload finish callback to happen when the

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,510
cursor is swapped. Then, we can tell the list view to set selection

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,020
on that position, and that position will be scrolled into view.
