Thanks for your answer. If you tried talkback on the

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,890
Sunshine app, you'll notice that one easy fix to make our

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,210
app more accessible is to add content descriptions to our image

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,240
views. 'Cause there's no spoken text when a user talks on

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,100
it. In the forecaster adopter after we read the weather

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,130
forecast from the cursor, we also set it as a content

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,240
description on the icon. Similarly, in the detail fragment, once we

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,520
get the weather forecast, we set that as the content description

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,510
on the icon. Now clicking on the image speaks the weather description out loud.
