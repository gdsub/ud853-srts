1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,130
We mentioned this several times. Put the SW in

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,190
the resource folder name stands for smallest width. To drive

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,280
home that point, let's walk through a hypothetical situation. Say

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,760
you have an app directory structure like this. We have

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,140
some layouts defined in the base layout folder and

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,070
we override some of those in the layout-sw600dp folder. We

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,790
also override one of these in the layout-sw720dp folder. Let's

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,320
look at which layouts would be applied on which device.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,740
Say your app is running on a Nexxus five.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,510
The Nexxus five has dimensions 360 dp by six 640

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,610
dp. Of the two, the smallest width is 360 dp.

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,350
So we use this number to compare it against the

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,950
folder names. 360 dp is less than 600 and

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,020
is less than, 720 so all the layouts will come

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,420
from the space layout folder. For the Nexus 72012 version,

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,950
the dimensions are 600 dp by 960 dp. Of the

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,470
two sides 600 dp is the smaller width. So you compare

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,830
this against the folder names. It turns out that the smallest width

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,710
is greater than or equal to 600 dp, so for the

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,800
detail and the item layout, we pull it from this folder. Now

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,370
the main .xml file is not declared in this folder, so

22
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,020
we fall back to a less specific folder, which turns out to

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,968
be this one in the base layout folder. For the Nexus ten,

24
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:15,920
the dimensions are 800 dp by 1280 dp. Of the two sides,

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,220
800 dp is the smallest width. Now this device satisfies

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,100
the categories for all of these because 800 is greater than

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,990
720 and greater than 600. However, the system chooses the

28
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,550
most specific folder first. So it will choose this item layout

29
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,050
over these two. Since the detail layout is not defined

30
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,820
here, it will fall back to a less specific folder, which

31
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,810
is this one. Then for the main.xml file, it's not declared

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,930
in either of these, so it falls back to this one.
