Andy Rubin, head of Google's Android team in 2013,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,540
famously defined Android's openness with this Tweet, offering the

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,500
instructions for downloading and building the Android source code.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,020
As app developers, it's handy to be able to peep

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,530
behind the curtains and see how the framework actually

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,070
works. And it's an excellent way to find answers to

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,230
tricky, Stack Overflow questions. But the Android Open Source

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,580
Project, or AOSP as its commonly known, is much more

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,170
than that. The source code is available under the

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,000
Apache 2 license, so anyone can take it and do

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,290
anything they want with it, including modifying it and redistributing

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,830
it. And they have. Android has always had a passionate

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,945
community of modders, from Steve Kondik and the Cyanogen community

14
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:44,240
to XDA and many others who have been distributing modified

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,100
images of Android for phone owners brave enough to try

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,580
them. Even big companies like Amazon have taken the Android

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,500
source code and modified it for use in their own

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,420
line of products. That openness extends to the apps themselves, the

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,790
AOSP includes key mobile apps like the dialer, app launcher,

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,170
calendar, and email. And Google offers it own versions of each

21
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,000
as well. In the early days those native apps were

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,870
tightly bound to the framework and could only get updated along

23
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,170
with the platform. Which admittedly in the early days seemed like

24
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,230
every few weeks. But as the time between platform releases grew,

25
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,860
so did the efforts to unbundle those apps, allowing

26
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,840
them to be updated through Google Play. That was great

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,670
news for users, but it had an even better

28
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,140
side effect for us developers. Because apps like Gmail and

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,170
Maps depend on a number of proprietary Google APIs,

30
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,140
Google released Google Play Services. Also code named after food

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,920
to support the Google apps, while also giving us

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,850
developers Google specific APIs, like Maps, Wallet, Drive, and YouTube.

33
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,480
So now we get the latest and greatest Google specific APIs

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,110
every six weeks or so. And rather than being tied to

35
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,540
a specific platform, they're available on every device, back to Gingerbread.

36
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,580
Oh, and of course every native app is also entirely replaceable.

37
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,830
So you can publish apps to replace any of the apps

38
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,490
shipped with the device. And we can build our own SMS

39
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,910
apps, homescreens or maps apps, publish it on Play and give

40
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,070
users the choice to make it their default. When Android was first

41
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,550
announced, Andy Rubin described the AOSP as, all the software

42
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,340
to run a mobile phone but without the proprietary obstacles

43
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,860
that have hindered mobile innovation. Today, Android runs on more

44
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,580
than just mobiles, but the core of its purpose remains

45
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,383
the same. A platform and ecosystem that allows models, carriers,

46
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:26,470
OEMs and app developers to innovate and compete. So, armed

47
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,560
with an open, evolving platform enriched by a growing set

48
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,380
of Google API's and the ability to create great apps

49
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,470
that let users customize every aspect of

50
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,270
their user experience, you can use other people's

51
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,640
work to help define the computing platform of

52
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,870
the future. And that's my definition of open.
