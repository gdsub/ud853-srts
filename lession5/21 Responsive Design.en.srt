1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,890
Okay. So now we have the wireframes implemented for both screens.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,080
But what does it look like on the tablet? Well, unfortunately,

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,920
when we take the phone UI and stretch it out on

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,630
a tablet, it doesn't look that great. There's a lot of empty

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,690
white space here. We could better take advantage of this screen

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,860
real estate by showing more useful information. For example, why do the

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,310
details need to be a tap away when they could just

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,380
as easily fit on this screen? And, furthermore, if the user wants

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,850
to look through the full list of forecasts, their eyes

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,380
must go like this, which is an unpleasant reading experience. If

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,960
we want the user to read some content, we should keep

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,340
the width narrower, so that they can scan it quickly. These

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,080
considerations are part of responsive

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,400
design. Responsive design means designing your

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,190
app by keeping in mind that it'll be used across a

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,230
range of different device screen sizes. But how do we do

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,540
that, and what does it mean to build for larger screen

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,700
devices like tablets. Well, I can show you some examples of

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,420
how apps adapt using multi-pane layouts. In the Android Design Guide,

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,000
there's a section on multi-pane layouts. One technique is to combine

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
multiple views together. For example, in the People app, you have

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,800
the contact list and the contact card for additional details. On

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,240
the tablet, we can put them side by side. This is

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,120
also known as the master detail flow. This is the master

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,580
list and this is the detail pane. In the settings app,

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,310
we have another example. The column width adjust based on the

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,430
available screen width. In the calendar app, we have panels, and

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,170
they stack vertically in the portrait orientation but horizontally in the

29
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,650
landscape orientation. There also a couple of other examples that you

30
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,550
can look through as well. If you want more information on

31
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,020
designing for tablets or responsive design in general, you can check

32
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,140
out the links below for more details. In this course, we're

33
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,390
learning how to build up the phone UI first, and then the

34
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,740
tablet UI. But in reality, when we're designing

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,970
it, we thought about responsive design from day

36
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,010
one. When you're building your own app, it's

37
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,550
bad practice to just completely design and build

38
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,390
your phone app and then start to brainstorm

39
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,810
about the tablet UI. That's because the tablet

40
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,780
UI often has an impact on the phone

41
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,510
design, as well as the architectural decisions made here.
