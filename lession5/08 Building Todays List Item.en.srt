1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,630
Next, we'll create the Today List Item. Since this layer is different from

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,790
the other list items, we're going to need to create a new XML file under

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,730
the resources layout folder. Use the same place holder image as you did before.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:18,250
Also use the same IDs that you declared in the list_ item_forecas_xml file.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,152
For example, in our code we called this list item icon, and

6
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:25,110
we callled this list item date text view. So we use those same ID's for

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,390
the elements in this XML file. You'll see why when we introduce view holders

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,180
later. After you've finished adding it, make sure the app still compiles.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,410
You won't see any visual difference until the next step.
