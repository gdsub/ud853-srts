1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,270
一旦两个窗口在平板中显示了，让我们来
Once the two panes are showing up on a tablet, let's

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,390
把我们的程序修改修改，这样当列表被选择了，我们就可以响应。
modify our code to handle the list item click. On the phone,

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,050
在手机里，如果是前端选项被点击，我们需要
if an item is clicked in the forecast fragment, then we

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,430
启动详细的活动。 在平板的界面里，如果一个选项
must launch the detail activity. On the tablet UI, once an item

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,720
是在前段被选择了，我们需要通知主要活动，
in the forecast fragment is clicked, we notify the main activity,

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,360
这样详细的界面会代替。原因是这两个fragments
which goes and replaces the detail fragment. The reason the two fragments

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,730
不会互相交流。因为们需要来维持一个虚拟抽象的概念。
don't talk to each other is because we want to maintain abstraction from

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,100
如果我们设想前端列知道了详细列表总是在它
each other. If the forecast list fragment started assuming that the detail

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,360
右边，这个设想就会被破坏。
fragment was always right next to it, then the assumption would break.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,360
例如，手机里详细的fragment 不在
For example, on the phone where the detail fragment is not inside

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,170
主要活动中。 这时我们的fragment必须要通过自身的活动来
the main activity. Therefore our fragment must go through its activity and

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,990
分配事件来支持其他的
the activity must know how to dispatch the event to the other

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,000
fragment。 让我们保持这样的想法，我们的fragment不一定总是在同样的
fragments. Keep in mind that our fragment doesn't always have to be

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,860
活动中工作， 为了能够让前段的fragment可以和
used in the same activity, in order for the forecast fragment to

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,280
主要活动沟通，我们必须创建一个反馈接口。
talk to the main activity we should create a callback interface. It's

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,390
最好来设想
a better assumption to say that the fragment will always be within

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,730
an activity that implements this callback than to say that

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,980
the forecast fragment will always be inside the main activity. The

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,660
detail fragment is a good example of how a fragment can

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,170
be used in two different activities. The main activity and the

21
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,120
detail activity. So don't rely on get activity returning a

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,830
specific activity class. Using the gist that we provided, use a

23
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,750
callback class to notify the activity that a list item has

24
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,310
been selected. See the hint below on the item click listener.

25
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,622
Then the activity can either launch the detail activity or

26
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:21,230
replace the detail fragment, based on whether it's a phone or

27
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,460
tablet. When you work on this task, you'll run into

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,860
an issue of how to pass the selected date to the

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,120
detail fragment. Now your instinct might say to create a

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,910
custom constructor where you can pass in the date. However, we

31
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,130
don't normally create custom fragment constructors. If you ever rotate the

32
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,790
device, for example, the system can't call your custom fragment constructor

33
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,980
with the right parameters, however it can use the

34
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,270
empty fragment constructor and initialize it with the same bundle

35
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,930
of arguments you used earlier. So to pass information to

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,950
initialize a fragment, create a bundle of key value pairs,

37
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,480
and then set that as the arguments on the

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,330
fragment. Don't confuse this arguments

39
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,870
bundle with the savedInstanceState bundle.

40
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,350
Once a fragment has been initialized, you can't change the

41
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,460
arguments. You can only read from them, as seen here.

42
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,500
On the other hand the saved state bundle is for storing information

43
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,900
once a fragment has been running. And you can populate it in

44
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,980
the on savedInstanceState method. The bundle

45
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,510
can preserve state across orientation changes

46
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,270
or if the fragment or activity gets killed by the system. That's why

47
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,950
you receive it back again in the onCreate or onCreateView methods. This

48
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,030
is what the app should look like when you're done. When you

49
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,170
tap on a different date, it updates the detail pane. You can

50
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,970
remove any hard coded data because

51
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,880
the layout should be populated dynamically now.
