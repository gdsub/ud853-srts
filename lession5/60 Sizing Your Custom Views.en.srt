00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,635
Knowing the standard widget library is nice, but as someone who

2
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:08,430
was once accused as not so much recreating the wheel, as hand

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,280
machining my own nuts and bolts, I know there are times

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,990
when nothing in the tool chest will quite do the job. That's

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,470
when it's time to dive in and build you own custom

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,900
view from scratch. Now we're not going to be including any custom

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,170
views within Sunshine, but we can still take a look at how

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,240
you would build one. We'll start by creating a new class for

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,250
our view. Let's call it My View. If

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,650
you're building something from scratch, rather than modify an

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,159
existing view, it should descend from either view

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,760
itself or from surface view. View offers a light

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,820
weight, canvas-based approach, while surface view is designed

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,085
specifically to support UI elements that require rapid redraws

15
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,140
and/or 3D graphics, using something like Open GL.

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,660
It's perfect for views that display video or games.

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,550
Now the existing widget library is entirely view

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,610
based. So let's take that approach. The base view

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,300
class draws an empty borderless 100 by 100 pixel

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,830
box. To change that, we override the onMeasure handler,

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,160
which allows us to indicate the view size.

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,040
We'll also override onDraw, in order to draw our

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,180
own custom view content. Now if it turns out

24
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,810
that your view should always be an empty 100

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,690
pixel box then you're in luck. Otherwise we need to do

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,790
some work. So let's start by setting our view's size. onMeasure is

27
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,190
called when your view's parent is laying out it's children. As

28
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,970
you know, when you add a view to a layout you can

29
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,310
specify a specific height or width, but in most cases you'll

30
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,860
want to either match parent or wrap the content. When a view's on

31
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,270
measure is called by its parent layout, it asks, how much space

32
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,360
will you use? And passes in how much space is available, and

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,110
whether the view will be given exactly that much

34
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,630
space, or at most that much space using these parameters.

35
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,650
You can decode those parameters like this. And that'll allow

36
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,970
you to obtain the size and the mode for your

37
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,780
height and width specifications. In this example we're demonstrating just

38
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,820
for the height parameter, but it works the same for

39
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,000
width. We can then use the decoded mode parameter to

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,940
find out what size we should set our view to.

41
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,970
If the returned mode is exactly, the view will be placed

42
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,740
into an area of exactly that size. You'll be passed that

43
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,460
value if the layout has specified a specific size or if

44
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,030
the view has been asked to fill the parent. In either case,

45
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,370
it's best practice to simply return the value passed in, unless

46
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,160
that value is below your views minimum size, in which case

47
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,740
you can return the minimum value and rely on the parent

48
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,910
layout to crop or scroll as necessary. Another alternative is AT_MOST. This

49
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,750
indicates that your view can define its own size, up to the

50
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,300
size given. This is typically the case for views set to wrap

51
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,790
content, where the view should be as wide as it needs to

52
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,100
be to display its content, but no wider than that. And of

53
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,900
course all of that's provided that it still fits within the parent

54
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,280
container as indicated by the size

55
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,260
parameter. Now we've just finished calculating

56
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,580
all of that for the height parameter and you'd need to do

57
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,060
exactly the same thing again for width. Once you've done that and

58
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,150
determined the size of your control, you have to call

59
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,050
the setMeasuredDimension method. Here you pass in your width and

60
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,229
height values. If you don't call these setMeasureDimension method, your

61
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,050
app will as soon as your view is laid out.
