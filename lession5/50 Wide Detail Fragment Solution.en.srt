00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,250
We build a wider detail fragment layout, using a

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,310
horizontal linear layout composed of three vertical linear layouts. This

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,280
is what the XML code looks like. And you

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,020
can see it linked below. Then we use layout aliasing

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,232
to override the fragment detail layout. In the values-land

6
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:20,100
and values-sw600dp folders, we create res.xml files. In both files,

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,200
we alias fragment detail through fragment detail wide. And

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,550
now we have a more responsive layout to wider screens.
