1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,840
Before we start creating our content provider,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,440
it's time to go back to our weather

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,470
contract. We're going to use the weather contract,

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,980
for both database definitions and content provider definitions.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,310
These are the URIs that our contract will expose for a data and view. Some of

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,279
them return a list or directory of items.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,740
And some of them return as single item.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,620
The first part of the URI is the content authority which is how the system

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,590
disambiguate URIs from different application, similar to the

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,060
relationship between a domain name and its website.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,120
A convenient string to use for the content

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,250
authority is the package name of the app.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,190
Let's return to our weather contract. We'll add

14
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,390
the CONTENT_AUTHORITY and the BASE_CONTENT_URI for our content

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,010
provider to the beginning of our weather

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,060
contract. Next, we'll add strings to the base

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,470
path of our URIs. Each URI essentially points

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,660
to a different table. For each of our

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,310
tables, location entry, and weather entry, we

20
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:11,340
create a content URI that represents the base location for each table. Now,

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,140
we'll add some magical value to the location and weather entry contracts.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,020
These contain special MIME type prefixes that indicate that

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,740
the URI either returns a directory, list of items,

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,070
or a single item. Now, we're going to add some

25
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,360
URI builders and decoder functions in weather entry. It's

26
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,270
convenient to have this as it makes fewer places

27
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,270
in your code aware of the actual URI encoding,

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,252
keeping this knowledge in the contract. If you're just

29
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:41,500
going to have a URI with a standard integer

30
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,660
primary key, which is a typical way of distinguishing between

31
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,040
a query for item or the query for a list

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,240
of items, one can use the content URIs with appended

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,150
id function. Strings, such as a location setting, can be

34
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,900
appended with the append path function. We can also these

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,040
functions to add potentially useful query parameters. In this case,

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,730
we use a query parameter for the start date. Query

37
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,770
parameters are useful for when we have a fixed database

38
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,389
query that we want to have some limited parameterization

39
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,970
for. In this case, it will be a parameter for

40
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,150
our join between the two tables. Finally, we have

41
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,270
this function that builds a two part URI that contains

42
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,060
both location and date segments. Below this, we have

43
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,080
helper functions that help decode the URI structure. This hides

44
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,630
the URI structure form our code as well and

45
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,690
places all the knowledge in one place within the contract.
