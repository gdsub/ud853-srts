00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,092
All right. You're done. Let's take a look at my solution. All right. So, here's

2
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:10,657
what our addLocation function looks like, locationSetting, cityName,

3
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:14,630
latitude and longitude. Just like in our content

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,230
provider test, we can use getContentResolver to query

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,410
based upon the content URI. Remember that the

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,390
default location entry CONTENT_URI passes all of the

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,240
parameters into the database. So we can easily

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,030
construct a query containing the location setting to see if

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,020
it's in the database yet. If it's not, then the query

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,710
will return an empty set and we should insert the new

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,850
city name, location setting, latitude, and longitude into the database together.
