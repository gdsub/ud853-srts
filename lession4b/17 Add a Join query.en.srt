1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,760
When we first defined our tables we defined

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,510
the relationships in terms of constraints. Now, we

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,630
are going to implement that relationship into our

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,220
query using a join this join will allow us

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,690
to query the weather table for values from

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,520
a specific location setting. We'll start by adding a

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,570
SQL Ite query builder class variable at the

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,280
top of weather provider. We'll initialize the SQLI to

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,120
query builder in the static constructor for the

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,830
class, describing the join between both tables. Note,

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,700
since both tables have a column named _ID.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,980
We must explicitly use the table name in

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,600
order to disambiguate which underscore ID we are

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,050
talking about in the join. Then we can

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,030
define the query. The query is to find

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,600
using the question mark replacement syntax. These question marks

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,350
will be replaced by the query parameters. Since we

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,460
allow people to specify the start date in the URI,

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,160
we're also going to add a second selection, which includes

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,800
checking to see whether date text is greater than or

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,630
equal to our parameter. Next, we'll add a method to

22
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,550
get the weather by location entry, using the same query

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,970
builder. Note, that we fetch the parameters from our URI.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,620
And though the string arrays, they can be substituted into

25
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,620
our query. Note that if URI does not contain a start date we actually use

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,950
a different selection. Finally, we add the function

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,440
into the query routine of our content provider.
