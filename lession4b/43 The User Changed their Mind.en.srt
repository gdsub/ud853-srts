1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,710
All right, I get the hint. You actually want

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,140
this class to be finished sometime before the next

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,458
Android release happens. We're almost done. So we look

4
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:13,780
in ForecastFragment in onStart. We've actually been cheating a

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,190
bit. Every single time we get to onStart, we

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,150
actually update the weather. Let's get rid of that.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,890
It'll force us to actually have to use the

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,650
refresh function to get new weather, but it'll help illustrate

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,320
the cool stuff we're about to do with preferences.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,930
We're going to stop cheating here. In onPreferenceChange, if we're

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,065
not actually binding preferences, we're going to execute a new

12
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:37,710
FetchWeatherTask if there's a change in location. Otherwise, we'll just

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,450
notify our CONTENT_URI to allow our cursor to update.

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,060
We still have to do one more thing. In ForecastFragment

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,320
we've been using an instance variable, mLocation, to save the

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,330
preferred location we get when we're actually an onCreate loader.

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,110
We've been doing that because we've been planning to

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,040
use this for a while. Let's override another function. In

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,140
onResume we need to check to see whether or not

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,400
our location has changed. So if our location is not

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,470
equal to null and Utility.getPreferred location does not equal

22
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,870
location, well, then we can call update weather. Let's see

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,010
what happens. You see it immediately changed back. You didn't

24
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,982
see that loading because it didn't have to load anything.

25
00:01:16,982 --> 00:01:21,700
However, if we change settings to something else,

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,210
it's refreshing the background. Well, it turns out

27
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,250
updating weather doesn't actually help us here. Why?

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,900
Because our URI hasn't changed. Remember, we're doing

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,720
everything based upon URI. What we really need

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,800
to do is reset our loader. So, how

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,420
do we do that? Well, it's pretty straightforward.

32
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,020
Just like we did in onActivityCreated, we have to

33
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,360
use LoaderManager. So instead of calling updateWeather, what

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,270
we're actually going to do is call something else.

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,070
In this case, not an initLoader, but restartLoader.

36
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,480
It takes the same parameters as an initLoader. Now

37
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,040
let's try this again. That already looks better.

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,860
All right, let's change back to our own weather

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,810
again. And there we are. As you can see,

40
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,270
the weather is changing as we go from location

41
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,400
to location, but we still have this

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,030
problem. Obviously when we change settings here,

43
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,130
it doesn't affect anything, so we need to fix that. That's where you come in.
