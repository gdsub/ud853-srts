1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,780
While it's great that we can query our database

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,160
through the content provider, it would be nice if

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,200
we could also use the content provider to put

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,010
data in. We'll begin with the insert function. Let's fill

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,710
the insert function with the same URI matcher code

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,200
we had in the other content provider functions but with

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,080
one change. We're only going to match the base

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,770
URIs. There's a good reason for this. When we insert

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,820
into our database, we want it to notify every

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,630
content observer that might have data modified by our

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,370
insert. It turns out that cursors register themselves as

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,370
notify for descendents which means that notifying the root

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,760
URI. We'll also notify all descendents of that URI.

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,830
If we were to notify based on anything else

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,730
other than the root URI. Then a cursor listening

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,780
on the root URI will not get notified of a

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,690
change that would certainly impact it. So we have to

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,060
be very careful when doing that. For this reason it makes

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,780
a lot of sense to only allow insertions at our

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,390
root URI into our database. That way, it's very, very easy

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,000
to handle notifications. It means that we also don't have

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,420
to build a combination query for our insert. Containing a parameter

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,880
coming from the URI. With the rest of the parameters

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,850
coming from a function. So for weather we just pass the

25
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,760
parameters into a database insert call. We should

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,810
throw an exception if the insert fails. The

27
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,370
only trick here is to make sure we

28
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,470
return the correct value, which is a URI. Fortunately

29
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,700
we made a function to build these URIs

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,950
which contain the weather path followed by an

31
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,480
ID. Let's go task this. Once again, we

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,190
go to test provider and we modify our test.

33
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,520
Because after all it's supposed to be test insert

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,390
read provider. Here's our insert statement. Obviously it's still talking

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,280
to the database. We're going to want to make it

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,220
talk to the provider. As always, that's pretty straight forward.

37
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,170
We always get our provider by using our content

38
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,540
resolver so we can replace this insert statement with the

39
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,340
db with a content resolver instead. And of course

40
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,260
we don't use a content resolver against a table name.

41
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,120
Instead we do it against the WeatherEntry.content URI.

42
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,940
But there's still something wrong. Of course, we

43
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,600
don't actually return the weather row ID, we

44
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,440
return the URI. But we can still get a

45
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,390
weather row ID. How do we do that?

46
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,850
Quite simply. Using a helper function in content

47
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,240
URI's, and we don't really need that insert.

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,520
After all, we know that this content resolver function

49
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,052
isn't actually going to return unless the value is true. Now that we

50
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:38,052
finished that, let's run the test. And make sure that we can actually

51
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:43,783
insert using our content provider. And our test passed. Well, you know what

52
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:46,680
time it is. Time for you to write some of this as well.
