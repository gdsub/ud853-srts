00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,170
Now for the big quiz. In all seriousness, this is the most

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,880
complicated exercise I've given you so far this lesson. I want you

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,540
to implement the details view using the cursor loader and multiple text view

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,290
widgets. And I've got some hints for you. Use loaders

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,660
not adapters. What does this mean? Well, it makes sense. Your detail

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,850
view does not contain a list so you don't

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,010
need to use an adapter, but you can still

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,240
use the loader pattern. The loader pattern will automatically

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,080
observe for changes in the URI with a CursorLoader. The

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,600
second thing you want to do is pass the date

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,760
into your intent. The date is the important thing to

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,860
the detail you need to have passed into it

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,670
to properly query the content provider. Now remember, you can

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,290
actually get the current location settings from the utility function. So

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,730
all you really need is the date. I hope that helps.
