1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,170
We'll start by adding our call back functions

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,040
to our forecast fragment. Now know we have two

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,230
different options here for loader call backs. We want to

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,260
make sure that we're choosing the android.support.v4 callback so

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,780
we're compatible with Gingerbread. These take a generic

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,402
type. We're going to want to use cursor. And yes that

7
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:22,370
is Andriod.database.cursor. Now, let's move down to where we

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,380
want to actually insert this code. Here at the bottom

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,390
and, of course, we use control I to actually insert.

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,250
And there we have it beautifully, our loader pattern with cursor.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,256
Now let's do some work that will help us out. First

12
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:38,270
we're [INAUDIBLE] of columns to the top of our forecast fragment.

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,590
These are the columns that are going to be used in our

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,490
query. Note, that since both weather entry and location entry have

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,720
the underscore ID field, we must fully qualify, which ID we

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,460
want in our projection for this query to work. And in

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,110
fact, this query requires a projection to work at

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,190
all, otherwise [UNKNOWN] ambiguous. Next, here are indexes that

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,710
are tied to these columns. This'll make some of

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,200
our work easier, later on. Note, that these actually must

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,420
match. Then we create some public indexes to use,

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,730
in our adapter. This allows us to make our

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,190
code tiny and efficient, in the adapter. But it

24
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,950
means, we must maintain the relationship between these column indexes.

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,530
And the projection. Each loader has an ID. It

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,750
allows a fragment to have multiple loaders active at

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,080
once. We're [INAUDIBLE] place this along with an instance

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,820
variable to save off our location here at the

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,535
top of our class. Next we're going to override

30
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:33,310
onActivityCreated. Loaders are initialized

31
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,980
in onActivityCreated because their life

32
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,800
cycle is actually bound to the activity. Not the

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,350
fragment. Note the use of the loader ID. FORECAST_LOADER.

34
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,420
Then we return to the onCreateLoader function.

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,570
We add a new CursorLoader. This CursorLoader has

36
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,350
our query, including start date, columns, and sort

37
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,420
order. Our start date is actually in our

38
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,490
URI. Our columns are the ones we defined earlier, and our sort order is going

39
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,250
to be based upon COLUMN_DATETEXT ascending. Let's do

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,430
one last check. We want to make sure we're

41
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,150
using the support library version of all of

42
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,240
these classes, otherwise we won't get Android 2.3 compatibility.
