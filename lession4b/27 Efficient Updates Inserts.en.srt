00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,450
Well we're done with the core of our content provider,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,990
but there's still one more optional method that'll make things

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,250
much more efficient. We'll start by hitting Ctrl+O to look

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,940
at the functions we can override. It turns out there's

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,780
a function called bulkInsert. Anyone out there who has done

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,210
database work knows that putting a bunch of inserts into

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,610
a single transaction is usually much faster than inserting them

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,860
individually. Bulk insert allows us to do just that. The default

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,500
implementation just calls insert a bunch of times, but

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,610
we can wrap it in a transaction if we implement

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,250
it ourselves. We're only going to add support for

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,520
weather forecast transactions here, since they're the only we insert

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,150
in bulk. We start by calling db.beginTransaction. For each

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,340
ContentValues passed in, we insert and update the number of

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,890
records inserted. When we're done, we set the transaction

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,840
to be successful. Otherwise our records will not be committed,

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,020
and then rely on the finally statement to end the

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,500
transaction. In the default case, we just call the super

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,640
class. Remember, it does the insert, just not optimally. And

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,135
that's it, that's all we have to do to implement bulkInsert.
