1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:06,010
Alright, you're done. Let's start by uncommenting out that text.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,860
As you can see, you need that four cast string

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,550
to pass on to our detail activity. So what do

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,920
we use to get that four cast string? Well we're lucky

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,520
here, because we actually get the adapter view cast in.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,100
All we have to do is cast it at simple

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,190
cursor adaptor and then we can get the cursor. We

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,650
can move it to our position. Then, we can use string.format

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,870
to get a formatted string based on the values

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,460
of our columns. Note, once again the nice use

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,800
of our column intendacies. One ending curly brace and

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,640
let's move that intend stuff into there. And that's it.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,860
Now we'll be able to click on it again

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,490
and it'll actually go to our normal detail view.

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,990
Let's try it out. So here we are, there's

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,542
our list view and we go right into details. Pretty

17
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:56,180
cool. However, if we change our temperature units to imperial here

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,560
doesn't actually update. It would be nice if that, it was

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,480
based on the same kind of cursor model we have here.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,837
Something that was observing with the

21
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:06,501
content observer and would actually update.

22
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,567
[BLANK_AUDIO]

23
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:10,620
When we changed our setting.
