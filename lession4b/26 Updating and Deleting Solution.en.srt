1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,360
All right, you're done. Let's take a look

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,870
at the solution. Delete is actually pretty straight forward.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,140
Note that once again we have almost useless

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,370
parameters. S actually refers to our selection while our

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,400
strings here are actually our selection Rs. One

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,180
little trickiness in delete is that if you actually

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,840
put no selection in, it'll delete all the rows.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,710
I still want to make sure we notify the change.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,090
I've done the slide optimization here. It would be

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,560
fine to just notify the change always, but I've decided

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,140
if no rows have been deleted, then we should

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,280
bother not notifying. Unless the selection is null, in which

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,940
case we deleted all the rows, but again, it

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,780
would be fine just to use notify change here even

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,380
if no rows are actually deleted. After all, the intention

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,730
was that rows would be deleted. Once again, let's take

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,910
pity on someone who might have to maintain your code, and change

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,560
these default parameter names to something

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,670
more useful like selection and selectionargs.

20
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,090
Other than that, update looks almost exactly like delete. Once

21
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,080
again, we are returning the number of rows impacted by

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,100
the update, and we don't bother notifying if no rows

23
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,530
were impacted. Now that we've finished writing update and delete, we

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,080
can go back to test provider and add some tests.

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,120
First, let's remove test delete.db, the last test that doesn't depend

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,930
on the provider. Instead, let's have a test that deletes

27
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,100
all the records and checks to make sure they're actually deleted.

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,970
Remember, passing a null query actually deletes all of the

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,340
records in a table. So this is really straight-forward, just passing

30
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,850
nulls. Since we're depending on the database for our deletes, it's

31
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,770
not all that particularly important that we actually test the delete

32
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,190
functions, although it would be nice to add that later on.

33
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,020
The reason we'd want to add it is to make sure that

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,780
our constraints are valid. And once we're done doing the deletes,

35
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,860
we check to make sure that there are no rows left.

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,040
Note that we have to delete weather entry before we delete location

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,620
entry, because you've got constraints in the database that prevent weather entry

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,740
from existing if location entries do not also exist and would also

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,640
prevent the deletion of those entries. So let's check to see whether

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,610
that actually works. All right, that passes. Good news. Now we can

41
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,770
add the same test to the end to make sure we can

42
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,700
delete all of the rows at the end and it still works.

43
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,240
And as you can see, they still pass. So now we know we've

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,810
deleted records before and after running tests. Now, let's try

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,170
that update. We'll do just an update of the location.

46
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,340
Again, let's start by deleting all records and inserting a

47
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,030
record that we want to update. One of the nice things about

48
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,240
content values is you can actually copy them using a

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,230
copy constructor. After that, we can add the ID we

50
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,660
want to update and then put the name of the city

51
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,440
we want to update it to. In this case, from North Pole

52
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,420
to Santa's Village. And then, finally, we call update.

53
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,175
Assert that we've actually updated exactly one record as

54
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:55,600
we'd expect, and then do a query on that,

55
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,980
validating our cursor, making sure that our update actually works.

56
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,700
And then finally, we close our cursor. It all

57
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,370
looks pretty good. And let's see that it actually runs,

58
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,910
and does the right thing. And our tests pass.

59
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,550
So, we've now proved that we can update, delete, insert,

60
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,250
and query and all this is fully tested.

61
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,280
In other words, the bones of our application

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,850
are finished, just waiting to attach our UI.

63
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,510
Let's go through and attach some of our UI.
