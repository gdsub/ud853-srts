1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,610
Now we have to test this. Let's go back to

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,930
test provider once more. It'll be helpful to parameterize our tests

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,510
a little bit more, both for location and for date.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,780
All right, now that we've parameterized our tests, let's go back

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,840
at looking into our insert read provider. For the weather,

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,740
we're currently using the raw content URI to query. But we

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,290
can also query on additional data. By cutting and pasting

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,130
this text, we can try the text with different query parameters.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,920
We'll close the cursor because it's good

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,150
practice. Now for our second weather query,

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,720
we're going to test the first of

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:40,010
our new URIs: WeatherEntry.buildweatherlocation and we can use

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,180
our new task location parameter. Alright, let's

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,220
try running this test. And our test

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,370
passed. Alright. We're going to add one more

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,580
test with a slight variation on the query

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,340
using build weather location with start

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,420
date, instead. So, we're going to use test

19
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,910
location as well as test date. And now, let's run those tests. And

20
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,890
our tests pass. Now, sometimes it's

21
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,020
useful to actually demonstrate a test failure.

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,420
Let's put in a date that's certainly going to fail, 20150624. We would

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,360
expect this test to fail. Let's try it and indeed it fails. So

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,050
we're pretty sure that our tests are actually doing what we expect them to.
