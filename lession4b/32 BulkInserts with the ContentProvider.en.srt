00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,161
All right. Now we're back to interacting with our ContentProvider, so it's time

2
00:00:04,161 --> 00:00:05,881
to have another exercise. Use the

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,956
ContentProvider to insert the vector of content

4
00:00:08,956 --> 00:00:11,330
value objects into the database. [LAUGH]

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,863
Don't worry, we're really almost done with

6
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:16,420
inserting data. Next is the fun part that makes this all worth it.
