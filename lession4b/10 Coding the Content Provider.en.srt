1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,260
Before we start coding our content provider, let's

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,000
make sure the manifest is set up correctly.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,760
You need to update the androidmanifest.xml file within

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,550
the application tag to add the content provider. So

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,140
that android's content resolver can see it. The

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,030
authority really should match your package name. While

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,860
the name indicates which file your content provider

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,730
class is in. Next, let's code up on create.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,380
We'll begin by creating an instance variable for our

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,650
database helper. In on create, we initiate our instance variable.

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,490
We return true, which is how we tell Android that

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,150
the content provider has been created successfully. It turns out

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,060
that we can repurpose the same test we did

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,200
for the database to test our new content provider. This

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,920
will allow you to both test your content provider code

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,060
and see how the content provider calls replace the SQLI

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,240
database calls. Let's start by using Android

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,730
Studio to copy TestDB to test provider.

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,050
Let's rename test create DB, to test delete DB.

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,740
So we can start with a clean slate. We'll just leave the M context dot delete

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,850
database line in there. We'll leave the other

22
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,260
test the same, we'll get to it soon.
