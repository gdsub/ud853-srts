1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,190
Let's go back to coding the content provider. The first

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,860
of the required content provider methods we're going to implement

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,130
is getType. getType is used to return the mime type

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,420
associated with the data at the given URI. We use

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,010
the URI matcher we built earlier to match the given

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,890
URI against the expressions we've compiled in. For each match,

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,690
we return a unique mime time, that starts with either

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,400
V and D Android cursor item, for a single record or

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,153
V and D Android cursor dir for multiple items.

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,167
We've nicely already defined these strings in our WeatherContract, in

11
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:34,535
our tests, we're getting the type. We're going to compose

12
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,615
URIs, using the standard methods we have, inside of our

13
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:41,440
WeatherContract. Then, we're going to pass these in to

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,810
our content provider, through the ContentResolver. Which is how you

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,800
call all functions in content provider. And we're going to

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,380
make sure it matches what we have in the contract.

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,930
I've placed the actual values as comments so you can

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,830
see, really, what's going on. Note that some of these returning

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,150
type directory, which means they're going to return a list

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,030
of different items in their cursor. While others are returning type

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,020
item, which means they will only return a single item.

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,230
Next, we're going to have you finish up getType. You're going to add

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,970
the appropriate cases in this switch statement. But to return mime

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,270
types, the remaining URI types that we aren't yet handling. No,

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,960
there are only two to add, and they

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,875
really look just like the ones in WeatherContract.
