1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,650
现在我们有了数据库，我们可以利用好
Now that we have a database, we can take

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,420
Android的模式，将作为应用content provider的数据
advantage of an Android pattern to bind our view to

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,220
和界面连接起来
our data model known as a content provider. A content

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,810
content provider让我们想到数据
provider allows us to think of our view data in

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,010
就我们的 URL 而言，是一个适合我们应用的结构
terms of URIs which is a convenient structure for

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,020
我们可以显示不同的数据，来源于
our applications. We can have views display different data based

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,130
那些当前活动的URL。事实证明
upon which URI is currently active. As it turns out,

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,270
URL是这些Intents的主要数据成员
a URI is the primary data member for those Intents,

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,300
通过content provider和intents相结合
that Rato so gloriously described. With a combination

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,310
我们可以很方便地
of content providers and intents, one can nicely

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,730
将数据从视图中分离开来
decouple the data being displayed from the view.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,940
使用URL和data location
And there's one other great thing we get from

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,020
我们可以从中得到一件更棒的事情。
using URI with a data location. It's easy

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,890
这很容易让我们的数据库中注册用来观察location的通知部件
to have our database notify components that are registered

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,060
location的变化导致我们的光标去更新列表
to observe that location which causes our cursor

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,990
并且展示最新的数据
to update our list and show the latest data.

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,190
content provider会返回各种数据，但通常是，他们返回
Content providers can return all sorts of data but typically, they return either

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,440
的是一个列表，或者是一个单一列表项。这里是我们如何修改
a list of items, or a single item. Here's how one might modify our

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,440
去选择一个特定的日期的数据，而不是一定范围内的天数
query to select the data for a specific date, rather than a range of

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,770
在这种情况下包含了更多可以显示出来的信息
days which in this case also contains more information for the viewer to see.
