00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,730
All right. Now for a little fun exercise. If data that we needed to store

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,180
included images or other binary data, how would

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,580
we store it? Would we put the raw

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,530
data in the database? Would we store files

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,590
into a public folder on the device? Or

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,340
would we store the files in a private

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,790
folder, and reference the location in the database?
