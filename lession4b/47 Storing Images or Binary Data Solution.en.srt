00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,230
Let's talk about this. Honestly, it really depends on

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,210
the size of your data. For small amounts of

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,310
binary data, very, very small amounts of binary data,

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,070
you could actually put the raw data in the

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,770
database. There are blob types and those are supported

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,900
and work pretty well. However, as you start putting

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,230
larger data into the database, it gets pretty inefficient.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,860
And you end up writing a lot more code.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,430
Well, as far as storing the files in a public folder

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,420
on the device is concerned, well, that might work if you

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,640
actually wanted to share those files. But, typically, you don't want to

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,360
share those files with other applications. So, storing them in a

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,580
public folder on the device isn't a very good idea. But

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,580
the third option is pretty good. Storing the files in a

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,950
private folder and then referencing the location in the database. Now,

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,720
admittedly, you might not even need to put them into the database

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,510
at all. But it's often nice to do this if

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,520
you need to do any kind of queries on them. You

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,140
can store metadata in the database and store files in

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,850
a private folder. This is what Android does in the gallery.
