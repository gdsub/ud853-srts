00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,340
Adding support for the location insert, looks almost

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,520
identical to adding support for weather. We just have

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,030
to select the right table name, and return

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,460
the right location URI. But there's one more thing

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,140
to do. All we have to do is

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,570
call getContext().getContentResolver().notifyChange on the

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,120
URI that was actually passed

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,370
into our function. To notify any observers that need

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,350
to know that UI has changed. And that's it.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,510
We've now finished insert. However, of course,

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,510
we're never done without also adding a test.
