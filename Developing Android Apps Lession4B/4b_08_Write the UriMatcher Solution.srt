1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,029
好的，你完成了
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,720
希望你是用给定的buildUriMatcher函数开始的
Hopefully you started with
the provided buildUriMatcher function.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,440
我们从定义一个新的UriMatcher开始
包含NO_MATCH
We begin with the new UriMatcher
that contains the NO_MATCH


4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,710
函数因为我们不希望根节点匹配任何东西。
function because we don't want
the root node to match anything.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,610
这是保证代码可读性的典型习惯。
This is typical behavior to make
the code more easy to read.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,190
我正在创建WeatherContract.CONTENT_AUTHORITY.
的快捷方式
I'm making a shortcut to
the WeatherContract.CONTENT_AUTHORITY.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,840
我们的两个底层URI很简单
Our two base URIs are pretty simple.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,670
既然我们已经在WeatherContract中
定义了PATH_WEATHER和PATH_LOCATION 
Since we've already defined PATH_WEATHER
and PATH_LOCATION in the contract,

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,730
我们只需要把他们分配给对应的整型常量
we can just assign them to their
corresponding integer constants there.

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,515
对于PATH_WEATHER，我们将配对
多一个项目
For PATH_WEATHER, we're going to match
a path with just one additional item

11
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:38,560
WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION在其上面。
我们将配对
WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION we're going
to match a path that just has

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,180
附加的一个项目。
one additional item on it.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,832
因为地点可能是一个字符串
我们必须将其与星号匹配
Because location can be a string,
we have to match it with an asterisk.

14
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:47,450
对于WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION_AND_DATE
我们将与二者都进行匹配
For WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION_AND_DATE
we're going to match two path items.

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,440
第一个为我们的地点，一个字符串
The first one of course will
be our location, a string.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,030
但是第二个将会是我们的日期
这将会是一个数字
But the second one will be our date,
which will always be a number.

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,060
因为如此我们可以与#配对
Because of that we can
match with the hash sign.
