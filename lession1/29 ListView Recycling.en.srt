00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:04,120
ListView starts by requesting a view for every visible item, however many you

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,770
can fit onto the screen. It'll also create a couple in either direction to make

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,830
sure we can scroll without seeing a flicker as a new view is created and

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,470
populated. Then it creates new items just in time. So it's next in line to

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,550
be visible to the user. So if the user never scrolls to the bottom of the list,

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,220
the ListView will never request that view from the adapter. But this is really

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,780
just a half measure. As you can see, if the user keeps scrolling, we could

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,430
potentially just keep adding new views, even if they disappear off the top of

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,080
the screen. Eventually that's going to lead to the same impact in memory use and

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,230
performance as if we had just created all of these views directly at

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,980
the beginning. The solution is recycling each view as it scrolls off the screen,

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,270
allowing it to be reused when we need to show another item as it

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,080
moves into view at the top or bottom. So rather than having to create and

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,710
then hold in memory each item of the list as it comes in to view,

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,400
we only need to do the creation step for the number of visible items and

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,850
couple on either side. Then whenever a new list item comes into view,

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,130
we just update the data displayed in one of our items in our recycle bin.

18
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,200
The result? Less memory overhead, smoother scrolling and

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,680
less view management you have to do yourself. This same recycling behavior is

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,420
implemented across all AdapterView descended classes, such as GridView and

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,830
ListView, which also introduces the reason that the adapter isn't built

22
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,960
directly into these controls themself. By keeping them separate,

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,050
your adapter defines how to display each element of the underlying data,

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,480
while the adapter view implementation itself is responsible for

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,800
controlling how each of these elements is laid out. Be it a list or

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,880
a grid in these particular instances.
