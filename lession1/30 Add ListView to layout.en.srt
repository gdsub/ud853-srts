Thanks, Rado. Now that we know the distinct advantages of using a list view,

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,750
we can use a list view to display the list of weather forecasts in our app.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,580
Now, which file in the layout folder should we modify to accomplish this?

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,150
Well, we want to add the list view directly to the fragment. If you open up

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,690
the fragment_main.xml file, you'll notice that the layout includes a relative

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,360
layout as the parent view, as well as a child TextView. Modify this file so that

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,960
we show a ListView instead of a TextView and assign it an ID ListViewForecast so

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,460
we can reference it later. Also, since this layout only contains one child's

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,380
view, it would be more efficient to actually switch to a FrameLayout instead of

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,840
a RelativeLayout. After you make the changes, compile and

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,160
run your app. You'll be a little underwhelmed with the blank screen, but

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,030
that's okay. That's because we haven't populated the list view with data yet,

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,230
and that will come in a later step. Check the box when you're done.
