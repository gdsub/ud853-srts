1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,370
MainActivity is launched when you start the app. At the bottom of MainActivity,

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,450
we have PlaceholderFragment. PlaceholderFragment was generated by

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,060
the template we used when creating our project.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,380
A fragment is a modular container within your activity. In later lessons,

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,380
we'll look at how to use multiple fragments in a single activity. And

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,140
we'll actually explain why, we're using them at all. But for now,

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,160
our activity contains just this one fragment. So here in PlaceholderFragment,

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,700
is where we reference our UI layout resource, called fragment main.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,720
This XML file lives in the Resource's RES directory of our Project Folder. You

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,500
can see other kinds of resources here besides layouts, such as design assets or

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,910
drawables, or strings. When our activity runs, it creates this placeholder

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,370
fragment which then inflates the XML layout resource, converting everything in

13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,376
the XML file to a hierarchy of view objects in memory. By holding CTRL or

14
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:06,652
CMD, depending on your operating system, and clicking on this reference to

15
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:12,500
fragment main. Android studio will drop us right into the visual layout editor.

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,340
Once we're inside a layout XML file, we can switch between the design tab,

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,840
where we can drag and drop new UI elements and modify the layout visually. And

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,330
the Text tab, where we can see and edit the XML that defined the layout and

19
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,220
UI elements. All of the views we'll talk about here ultimately extend the view

20
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,460
base class. The template we used gives us a relative layout, with some padding

21
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,720
around the edges. We'll get into layout features like padding and margins,

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,425
later. Inside our relative layout, is a single TextView that says, hello world.

23
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:51,630
EditText, is a text entry field that is an editable version of text view.

24
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,240
It has many options, such as whether it supports single or multi line.

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,380
There are several styled versions of editText, in the text field section of

26
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,210
android studio. Such as Name, E-mail, Phone, or

27
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,230
Postal Address. Each one sets the soft keyboard into an appropriate entry mode.

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,580
ImageView displays the image defined in its source attribute.

29
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,990
It has some really useful features. Like zooming and copying if the source file

30
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,870
is to large or has a different aspect ratio than the image view itself.

31
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,140
A list view is a special kind of view that contains one or

32
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,490
more view that are replicated to display sets of data. In this

33
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,860
case the single textView is used to display the weather information replicated

34
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,810
throughout the list. We'll get into much more detail about list view later on.
