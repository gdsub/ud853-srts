Responsive design, I know. [LAUGH] It's fun to resize your web browser and

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,210
see which sites resize gratefully and which sites remain defiantly large with

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,470
gross horizontal scroll bars. But responsive design is not just for

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,580
the web. Today, the lines between phones and tablets are disappearing. So

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,140
it's important to think about your UI will scale in our multiscreen world.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,840
Don't be overwhelmed. Just like designing responsive layouts for the web,

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,760
build your layouts to be reasonably flexible or within a common device size.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,000
Then you can set break points, providing alternative layouts for

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,350
those various sizes. Think about it this way,

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,730
small phone, large phone, medium tablet, and large tablet.
