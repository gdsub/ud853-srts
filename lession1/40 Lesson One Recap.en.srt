00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:03,670
You accomplished a lot in this first lesson. Starting with nothing more

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,870
than Android Studio and hope, you've created your first project. Built and

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,390
deployed it to virtual and actual devices, and

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,910
even created a simple list-based UI that's populated using an adapter.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,480
You also learned a little about what makes mobile and Android, in particular,

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,690
a different environment to develop for the desktop, web, and server. But we've

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,090
only just gotten started. The app we've got so far is using static mock data.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,050
So join us in lesson two to learn how to hook it up to real weather data.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,070
But before that, take a moment to cleanse your palate with

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,020
a brief interlude exploring the history and evolution of the Android ecosystem.
