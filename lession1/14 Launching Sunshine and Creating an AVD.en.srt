1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,510
等待响应，点击该按钮运行程序。
Now for the moment you've been waiting for. Let's run the app by clicking on

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,490
它会提示我们选择设备。在没有物理设备时，
this button. It will prompt us to choose a device. Without a physical device we

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,210
我们可以使用 Android SDK 中的模拟器。
can use the emulator which is included in the Android SDK.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,050
但是现在，还没有创建android虚拟设备。
Currently it says that there are no Android virtual devices available. So,

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,060
让我们打开AVD管理器来创建一个。点击新建。
let's open up the AVD manager to create one. Then click New. By creating an AVD,

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,980
创建AVD时，我们可以配置一个测试需要版本和硬件选项的模拟装置。
we can configure an emulated device with the android platform version that we

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,150
对于我们来说，
want to test on, as well as hardware options. For our case,

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,850
我们需要配置的虚拟设备Nexus 5，选项默认就ok了。
we're going to emulate a Nexus 5 virtual device, the defaults are fine for now.

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,240
点击ok，现在我们可以看见一个被成功创建的AVD。
So, we're going to hit OK. Then we see that our AVD was created successfully.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,150
关闭AVD管理器。回到设备选择器对话框，
We can close the AVD Manager. And when we go back to the Device Chooser dialog,

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,050
可以看见有Nexus 5这个选项。点击OK,启动程序。
we'll see that Nexus5 is an option. Then we can hit OK to launch the app.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,980
程序加载，我们可以看见Sunshine程序上显示的"Hello world"。
When it loads up, we see our Sunshine app with the words Hello world.

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,780
请记住，模拟器不仅仅是一个模拟器。
Keep in mind that the emulator is not just a simulator.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,510
它是实际运行Android虚拟机。
It's actually running the Android Virtual Machine. So you can test and

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,300
所以你可以在不同的硬件和软件配置上测试和调试你的程序。
debug your app on different hardware and software configurations.

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,520
你可以在模拟器的屏幕上操控导航来与模拟器进行交互。
You can interact with the app on the emulator using the screen or

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,060
你也可以调用其他的应用程序，
with the navigation controls here. You can also invoke other apps,

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,850
比如网络电话、音乐播放器、视频播放器等。
do network calls, play audio or video and much more. It also includes debug

19
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,410
它还能够调试、输出日志，以及捕捉模拟应用程序和延迟网络的能力。
capabilities, including log output, and the ability to simulate app entraps or

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,560
你也可以返回主页，查看其他的应用程序。
network latency. You can also hit Home and browse around the device to see other

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,350
例如，你可以查看API demo。
apps. For example, you can check out API demos. Feel free to

22
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,570
自由的使用你的模拟器。当你打开Android设备检测器时，
play around with the emulator some more. If you open up Android Device Monitor,

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,650
你可以进入模拟器控制选项卡。
you can go into the Emulator Control Tab. There you'll see different options for

24
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,626
你将看见不同选项的模拟行为，例如电话和定位。
simulating behavior on your AVD, such as for telephony and for

25
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:43,910
现在，那句"Hello world"正在应用程序上执行着，
location. Now that the Hello world app runs on the emulator,

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,710
让我们看看这背后是如何让程序跑起来的吧！
let's see what goes on behind the scenes to make the app run.
