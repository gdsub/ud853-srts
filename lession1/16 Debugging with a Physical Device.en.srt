Thanks Veto. And now it's time to install the Sunshine app on our phones.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,230
So to get started, let's grab a USB cable. We'll plug in our device and

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,680
then we'll need to enable USB debugging. This can be found in Developer options

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,090
in the Settings app. But note that on Android devices 4.2 and above,

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:27,270
the option is actually hidden by default. To find the secret menu,

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,650
go to the Settings app. Scroll down to About phone.

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,066
Then go down to Build number and

8
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:41,627
tap on that seven times [SOUND]. Then,

9
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:45,350
when you go back to Settings, you'll see the Developer options menu appear.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,260
Also, set up your computer to detect your device. Check the instructor notes for

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,680
more details. We're going to continue using a device because it's faster and

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,270
smoother for development. But if you don't have one,

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,900
that's okay. You can continue using the emulator that we created previously.
