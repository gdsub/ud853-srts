1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,930
就像我之前说的一样，早期的Android版本
As I said before, early versions of Android

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,130
是没有加载器模式的。原先被弃用的模式
didn't have the loader model. The original deprecated model

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,908
造成了帧速率下降，使得许多应用不得不重新查询数据库
caused frame rate drops whenever many applications had to

4
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:14,750
即便是一个简单的应用，所得到的数据库也比我们在Sunshine应用中
re-query their databases. Even simple ones. Databases get far

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,329
拥有的复杂得多
more complex than what we have here in

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,630 
所以第一个答案是确定的
Sunshine. So the first answer is a definite yes.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,980
我们注意到像AsyncTask这样是如何与UI界面相连接的
We noted how things like AsyncTask are bound to

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,450
所以就算是一个细微的方向改变也会杀死查询进程
the UI, so something as little as an orientation

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,780
因此，另一个答案也是确定的
change could kill the query. So that's another definite

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,224
所以第三个选项肯定是错误的
yes. So the third option is just a non-starter.
