00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,550
We've spent a long time
building a content provider.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,780
But, we are only using
it just enough for

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,590
us to test that we got
the content provider working.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:14,020
When we query the database,
here's how these classes are used.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,810
Our UI, first, builds a URI,
using the weathercontract.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,080
The UI then uses this UI to call
a method in the Content Resolver.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,730
Which ultimately forwards
the request to our WeatherProvider.

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,270
Our WeatherProvider
uses Weather DB Helper

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,710
to get an instance of SQLite Database.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,290
Creating, or updating the tables
of our database is necessary.

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,510
We then pass the SQL query
to the SQLiteDatabase class,

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,840
which sends our query off
to our SQLite database.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,610
Cursor Loader takes the URI, and

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,370
calls the Content Resolver on our
behalf, inside of an AsyncTask.

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,380
Ultimately, the cursor gets
returned to the Android UI,

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,760
and it will be used by a cursor adapter,
to populate the list view,

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,380
in Sunshine from our database cursor.

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,230
Similar to the way our array adapter
populated the list view from an array.

19
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,180
For our next task, we are going
to replace the array adapter,

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,025
we have currently in forecast fragment,
with a cursor adapter.

21
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:13,030
We'll eventually connect it to our
database using a cursor loader.
