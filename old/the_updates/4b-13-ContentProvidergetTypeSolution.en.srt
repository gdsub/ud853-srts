1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:04,740
The WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION_AND_DATE
function can only return a single row.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,656
So we give it the ITEM_TYPE.

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:10,278
While the WEATHER_WITH_LOCATION
type returns multiple items.

4
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:13,270
So it gets CONTENT_TYPE, which is a dir.
